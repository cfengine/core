There is Elisp snippet in contrib/cfengine-code-style.el which defines the
project's coding style. Please use it when working with source code. The easiest
way to do so is to add

 (add-to-list 'load-path "<core checkout directory>/contrib")
 (require 'cfengine-code-style)

and run

 ln -s contrib/dir-locals.el .dir-locals.el

in the top directory of the source code checkout.
