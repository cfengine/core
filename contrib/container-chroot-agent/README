# CFEngine container chroot agent

The goal of the files in this directory is to install an agent in a container on a host system which for various reasons we don't want to or can't install and run the CFEngine agent.

- Torizon Core/Yocto hosts providing docker
- Kubernetes Nodes

# Usage

On a host system you have access to place these files and execute run.sh

See the other .sh files for various purposes:

- clean.sh - cleans the cfengine-chroot-agent container and image
- shell.sh - shells into the cfengine-chroot-agent container
- chrootshell.sh - shells into the chroot inside the cfengine-chroot-agent container, this is where CFEngine is available and running

# Impact on host

Since the chroot has the host systems root filesystem mounted it can affect many changes and execute many programs.
