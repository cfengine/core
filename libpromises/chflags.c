CHFLAGS(1)              FreeBSD General Commands Manual             CHFLAGS(1)

NAME
     chflags - change file flags

SYNOPSIS
     chflags [-R [-H | -L | -P]] flags file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The chflags utility modifies the file flags of the listed files as speci-
     fied by the flags operand.

     The options are as follows:

     -H      If the -R option is specified, symbolic links on the command line
             are followed.  (Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal
             are not followed.)

     -L      If the -R option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.

     -P      If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.

     -R      Change the file flags for the file hierarchies rooted in the
             files instead of just the files themselves.

     Flags are a comma separated list of keywords.  The following keywords are
     currently defined:

           arch    set the archived flag (super-user only)
           dump    set the dump flag
           sappnd  set the system append-only flag (super-user only)
           schg    set the system immutable flag (super-user only)
           sunlnk  set the system undeletable flag (super-user only)
           uappnd  set the user append-only flag (owner or super-user only)
           uchg    set the user immutable flag (owner or super-user only)
           uunlnk  set the user undeletable flag (owner or super-user only)
           archived, sappend, schange, simmutable, uappend, uchange, uimmutable,
           sunlink, uunlink
                   aliases for the above

     Putting the letters ``no'' before an option causes the flag to be turned
     off.  For example:

           nodump  the file should never be dumped

     Symbolic links do not have flags, so unless the -H or -L option is set,
     chflags on a symbolic link always succeeds and has no effect.  The -H, -L
     and -P options are ignored unless the -R option is specified.  In addi-
     tion, these options override each other and the command's actions are de-
     termined by the last one specified.

     You can use "ls -lo" to see the flags of existing files.

     The chflags utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

HISTORY
     The chflags command first appeared in 4.4BSD.
