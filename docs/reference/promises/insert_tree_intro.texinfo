This promise is part of the xml-editing model. It assures that a
balanced xml tree, containing the matching subtree, will be present
in the specified node within the xml file. If the subtree is not
found, the default promise is to insert the tree into the specified
node. The specified node is determined by body-attributes. The
promise object referred to is a literal string representation of a
balanced xml tree.
