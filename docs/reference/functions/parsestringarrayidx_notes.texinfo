@i{History}: Was introduced in version 3.1.5, Nova 2.1.0 (2011)

This function mirrors the exact behaviour of @code{readstringarrayidx()},
but reads data from a variable instead of a file
@pxref{Function readstringarrayidx}.  By making data
readable from a variable, data driven policies can be kept inline.
This means that they will be visible in the CFEngine Knowledge
Management portal.
