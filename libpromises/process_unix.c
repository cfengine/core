 *      is not, return, as we know for sure this is a wrong process. (This step
 *      is an optimization to avoid sending SIGSTOP/SIGCONT to wrong processes).
 *

 *
 *   3. Poll process state until it is stopped.
 *
 *   Now the process is stopped, so we may examine it and not be afraid that it
 *   will exit and another one with the same PID will appear.
 *
 *   4. Check that the process has the same start time as provided.
 *      If it is, send the signal to the process.
 *
 *   5. Send SIGCONT to the process, so it may continue.
 *
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on error. Error code is signalled through errno.
 *
 * ERRORS
 *
 *  EINVAL An invalid signal was specified.
 *  EPERM The process does not have permission to send the signal.
 *  ESRCH The pid does not exist or its start time does not match expected one.
