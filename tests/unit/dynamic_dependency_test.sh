# Tests that the symbols in our static libraries do not occur twice in the
# output binaries. Most platforms don't warn about this, but it has potential
# ill effects.
#
# How it can happen: It can happen if we list a static library as a dependency
# for libpromises, and then we list the same static library as a dependency for
# a binary that depends on libpromises. Then the symbol will be included both
# in the library and in the binary.
#
# What effects does it have: Exactly how the symbols are resolved appears to be
# platform dependent, but what can happen is this: At any point, when you call
# a duplicate symbol, depending on where you call it from, you will either call
# the version in the binary or in the library. This is fine, since they both
# contain exactly the same code. However, they do not refer to the same global
# symbols. They each have their own set. This means that something that was
# initialized in the binary may not be initialized in the library, even though
# the symbol name is the same. This has weird effects, like a symbol suddenly
# switching from a valid value to zero when the stack trace crosses a library
# boundary.
#
# The problem has been observed on AIX, where the log level randomly switches
# between verbose and non-verbose, depending on where the Log() function was
# called from. It has also been observed on certain Linux versions (Ubuntu
# 12.04).
#
# How do we test for it: By making sure that functions that are known to be in
# the static libraries are undefined in the binaries, which means that they
# will link to the shared library version, instead of using their own version.
