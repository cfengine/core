balanced xml tree, described by the given xpath, will be present
within the xml file. If the document is empty, the default promise is to
build the xml tree within the document. If the document is not empty, the
default promise is to verify the given xpath, and if necessary, locate an
insertion region and build the necessary portion of xlm tree within
selected region. The insertion region is selected as the last unique node
that is described by the xpath and also found within the document. The
