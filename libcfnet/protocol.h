/**
 * Receives a directory listing from a remote host.
 *
 * The server will use "/var/cfengine" as working directory if absolute path
 * is not specified. The server sends the directory entries as a string
 * separated by NUL-bytes, and ending with the magic string CFD_TERMINATOR.
 *
 * The function shall fail if connection is not established, or if the server
 * gives a bad response (denoted by a message preceded by "BAD").
 *
 * @param [in] conn  The connection to use
 * @param [in] path  Path on remote host
 * @return A sequence of filenames in the requested directory on success, NULL
 *         on failure.
 *
 * Example (for printing each directory entry):
 * @code
 *     AgentConnection *conn = ServerConnection("127.0.0.1", "666", ...);
 *     Seq *dir = ProtocolOpenDir(conn, "masterfiles");
 *     for (int i = 0; i < SeqLength(dir); i++)
 *     {
 *         char *entry = SeqAt(i);
 *         printf("%s\n", entry);
 *     }
 * @endcode
 *
 * In the protocol, this will look like this on the server side:
 *     Received: OPENDIR masterfiles
 *     Translated to: OPENDIR /var/cfengine/masterfiles
 *     Sends string:
 *     ".\0..\0cfe_internal\0cf_promises_release_id\0...

/**
 * Receives statistics about a remote file.
 *
 * This is a cacheless version of #cf_remote_stat from stat_cache.c. This
 * only supports sending with the latest cfnet protocol.
 *
 * When the `STAT` request is sent, it is sent together with the current time
 * since the Epoch given by the `time` syscall denoted by `SYNCH <tloc>`. If
 * the server is set to deny bad clocks (which is default), it will reject
 * `STAT` requests from hosts where the clocks differ too much.
 *
 * When the server accepts the `STAT` request, it will send each field of the
 * `Stat` struct from `stat_cache.h` as numbers delimited by spaces in a
 * single string. Since the `Stat` struct is not cached, its fields are
 * transferred to the \p stat_buf parameter.
 *
 * Example
 * @code
 *      AgentConnection *conn = ServerConnection("127.0.0.1", "666", ...);
 *      struct stat stat_buf;
 *      ProtocolStat(conn, "masterfiles/update.cf", &stat_buf);
 *      assert((stat_buf.st_mode & S_IFMT) == S_IFREG);
 * @endcode
 *
 * This is how the above example looks on the server side:
 *      Received: SYNCH 12356789 STAT masterfiles/update.cf
 *      Translated to: STAT /var/cfengine/masterfiles/update.cf
 *      Sends string:
 *      "OK: 0 33188 0 ..." etc.
 *
 * @param [in]  conn         The connection to use
 * @param [in]  remote_path  Path on remote host
 * @param [out] stat_buf     Where to store statistics
 * @return true on success, false on failure.
