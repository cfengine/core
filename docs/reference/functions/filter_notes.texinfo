Extracts a sublist of elements matching arg1 as a regular expression (if
arg3 is true) or as an exact string (if arg3 is false) from a list
variable specified in arg2.  In regular expression mode, the regex is
anchored.  @xref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}.

If arg4 is true, the matches are inverted (you get elements that don't match arg1).

arg5 specifies a maximum number of elements to return.
