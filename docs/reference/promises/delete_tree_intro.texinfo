This promise is part of the XML-editing model. It assures that a
balanced XML tree, containing the matching subtree, will not be
present in the specified node within the XML file. If the subtree
is found, the default promise is to remove the containing tree from
within the specified node. The specified node is determined by
body-attributes. The promise object referred to is a literal string
representation of a balanced XML subtree.
