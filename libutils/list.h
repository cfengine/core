/**
  @brief Double linked list implementation.

  A linked list is to be used when data needs to be stored and then sequentially processed, not for quick
  lookups. Prime examples of bad usage of a linked list is for instance having a list of files and then
  iterating over the list to find a particular file based on the name. A Map will be much better for this type
  of usage. A good usage for a linked list is to store a list of files that need to be changed sequentially.
  For instance a list of files that need to change permissions.

  A linked list should not be used when fast retrieval is important, for that it is better to use a Map.
  The implementation of the list is kept intentionally opaque, so we can change it in the future. It provides a
  reference counted list with copy on write. In order for this to work the user needs to provide at least a copy
  function. The List is used at its full potential if the user provides three helper functions:
  - copy(void *source, void **destination)
  - compare(void *a, void *b)
  - destroy(void *element)

  It is highly recommend to at least implement the copy function, since that is the key for the copy on write implementation.
  The destroy function is recommended to avoid leaking memory whenever an element is destroyed. Notice that the
  list never copies the elements, so as long as the user still has access to the elements this function does not
  need to be implemented and the user then needs to delete the elements afterwards.

  The compare function is a nice to have function. It is used when the user wants to remove elements, in order to
  find the right element to delete. If this function is not provided, then the list will try to match the pointer.
  These three helper functions can assume that they will never be called with NULL pointers.

  A special note on the copy function. The copy function is analog to the copy constructor in C++, it takes a properly
  constructed element and produces a newly created element that is a copy of the previous one. The copy function
  needs to allocate memory for the new element and then fill it with the proper data. It should be avoid moving
  pointers around, it should copy the content to the new element so the new element is not tied to the previous
  element.

  The list can have many iterators, but only one mutable iterator at any given time. The difference between a normal
  iterator and a mutable iterator is the fact that with normal iterators only additions can be performed to the list
  without invalidating the iterator, while the mutable iterator allows any kind of change. Be aware that removing from
  the list, either by using remove or via the mutable iterator will invalidate all the normal iterators.

  Simple way to iterate over the list:

  ListIterator *i = ListIteratorGet(list);
  int r = 0;
  for (r = ListIteratorFirst(i); r == 0; r = ListIteratorNext(i))
  {
      MyData = ListIteratorData(i);
      ...
      Do something with the data.
      ...
  }
