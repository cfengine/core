Run detect_duplicate_keys.sh and wait 30-40 minutes.

It will run `cf-key -s` multiple times and will use
`detect_duplicate_keys.pl` to parse the output.

When done, it will show you the IP addresses of hosts that have the same
key (as happens when a VM is cloned or CFEngine key burned onto an image).
