/* Sharing file descriptors between processes.
 *
 * This presumes a local communication socket (archetypically a Unix
 * Domain Socket, opened with domain AF_UNIX - also known as AF_LOCAL)
 * between two processes on a single machine.  One process has an open
 * file descriptor (and possibly some accompanying data), to be passed
 * to the other process.  The former Put()s, the latter Get()s to
 * implement this.  See ../tests/unit/passopenfile_test.c for a test
 * that illustrates usage.
 *
 * The accompanying text is optional: if NULL is passed to Put(),
 * Get() shall receive NULL; in contrast, any non-NULL pointer (even
 * to an empty string) shall result in Get() allocating memory in
 * which to receive a copy (even if it's just allocating one byte in
 * which to store a '\0').  Texts over 1023 bytes shall be truncated.
 *
 * Details of how the local socket is established are left to the
 * callers; one end shall need to bind() a listen()ing socket so that
 * the other can connect() one end and the first can accept() the
 * other end.  Callers are responsible for ensuring the local sockets
 * are ready for use, e.g. by calling select().
 *
 * This allows a process that has accept()ed a connection to hand off
 * its socket (and the information accept() gave it about the other
 * end) to another process for handling; or allows one process to
 * initiate a connection and then hand it off to another to work with
 * it.  We use this where there is one process that naturally should
 * do certain jobs but some other process to which initiating the
 * connection, or accept()ing it, is more practical.
 *
 * Passing local file descriptors can also be used for privilege
 * separation, with a privileged process sending open descriptors to a
 * worker process that lacks privileges to open the files but handles
 * untrusted data so can't be trusted to perform access control
 * reliably.  However (see following) this only works on Unix.
 *
 * On MinGW (i.e. MS-Win), the present implementation can only pass
 * sockets, not local file descriptors.  It also may block, calling
 * select(), in its improvised protocol for exchanging needed
 * information over the local sockets.
 *
 * The essential activity here is the same as GNUlib's passfd, albeit
 * with a slightly different API (most notably, providing for
 * transmission of a text message accompanying the descriptor).
