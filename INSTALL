PREREQUISITES
-------------

In order to build CFEngine you need the following tools and libraries installed:

* C compiler supporting C90 + selected C99 constructs:
    - _Bool type
    - anonymous aggregates "(MyType) { .foo = 1, .bar = 2 }"
    - declarations in "for" loop
    - named initializers
    - uintmax_t and corresponding printf/scanf formats
  The following compilers are known to work:
    - gcc >= 3.0
    - clang >= 2.6
* GNU make

* OpenSSL library
* PCRE library
* POSIX threads (pthreads) library, if not provided by the operating system
* Tokyo Cabinet or QDBM

* MySQL client library (optional)
* PostgreSQL client library (optional)
* SELinux library (optional)
* libacl library (optional)

In order to build CFEngine cloned from git, you will need the
following additional tools:

* GNU Automake >= 1.9.5
* GNU Autoconf >= 2.59
* GNU Libtool >= 1.5.4
* Yacc (note: GNU Bison 2.4.2 has troubles invoking m4)
* Lex

Latest stable versions of the tools and libraries are generally advised.

OPERATING SYSTEMS
-----------------

CFEngine is regularely built and tested on the following operating systems:

* GNU/Linux (many distributions)
* FreeBSD
* NetBSD
* Solaris

HARDWARE PLATFORMS
------------------

CFEngine is regularely built and tested on the following CPU architectures:

* x86
* x86-64
* SPARC

OTHER CONFIGURATIONS
--------------------

In case you have succesfully compiled CFEngine on a different OS and/or using
different tools or versions of tools, please report it to help-cfengine@ mailing
list[1]. Please consider running a testsuite (see below), and posting results to
mailing list too.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

From tarball:

$ ./configure [configure options]
$ make [-jN]

From Subversion checkout:

$ ./autogen.sh [configure options]
$ make [-jN]

See the available configure options:

$ ./configure --help
or
$ ./autogen.sh --help

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

CFEngine might be installed in two configurations:

 * (default) Native CFEngine file layout. Everything is installed in
   /var/cfengine layed out as a "secondary FHS root". This layout is designed to
   keep CFEngine running even if most of the system is broken (e.g. /usr is not
   mounted due to NFS breakage).

* FHS file layout, enabled by --enable-fhs. This layout follows FHS 2.3.

After the build process has completed (see BUILD INSTRUCTIONS above), type:

$ make install

RUNNING TESTSUITE
-----------------

Please refer to the instructions in tests/README file.
