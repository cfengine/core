/**
  @brief Sequence data-structure.

  This is an array-list loosely modeled on GSequence. It is a managed array of
  void pointers and can be used to store arbitrary data. The array list will
  auto-expand by a factor of EXPAND_FACTOR (e.g. 2) when necessary, but not
  contract.  Because sequence is content agnostic, it does not support the
  usual copy semantics found in other CFEngine structures, such as
  RList. Thus, appending an item to a Sequence may imply a transfer of
  ownership. Clients that require copy semantics should therefore make sure
  that elements are copied before they are appended. Some Sequence operations
  may remove some or all of the elements held. In order to do so safely, it's
  incumbent upon the client to supply the necessary item destructor to the
  Sequence constructor. If the item destructor argument is NULL, Sequence will
  not attempt to free the item memory held.
