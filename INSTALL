PREREQUISITES
-------------

In order to build CFEngine you need the following tools and libraries installed:

* C compiler supporting C90 + selected C99 constructs:
    - _Bool type
    - anonymous aggregates "(MyType) { .foo = 1, .bar = 2 }"
    - declarations in "for" loop
    - named initializers
    - uintmax_t and corresponding printf/scanf formats
  The following compilers are known to work:
    - gcc >= 3.0
    - clang >= 2.6
* GNU make

* PAM library
* OpenSSL library
* PCRE library
* POSIX threads (pthreads) library, if not provided by the operating system
* Latest available LMDB (Lightning Memory-mapped DataBase), Tokyo Cabinet or QDBM

* MySQL client library (optional)
* PostgreSQL client library (optional)
* libacl library (optional)

In order to build CFEngine cloned from git, you will need the
following additional tools:

* GNU Automake >= 1.10.1
* GNU Autoconf >= 2.60
* GNU Libtool >= 1.5.24
* Yacc (note: GNU Bison 2.4.2 has troubles invoking m4)
* Lex

Latest stable versions of the tools and libraries are generally advised.

See INSTALL DEPENDENCIES below for example of deps for various systems.

OPERATING SYSTEMS
-----------------

CFEngine is regularly built and tested on the following operating systems:

* GNU/Linux (many distributions)
* Solaris
* Windows with MinGW

HARDWARE PLATFORMS
------------------

CFEngine is regularly built and tested on the following CPU architectures:

* x86
* x86-64
* SPARC

OTHER CONFIGURATIONS
--------------------

In case you have successfully compiled CFEngine on a different OS and/or using
different tools or versions of tools, please report it to help-cfengine@ mailing
list[1]. Please consider running a testsuite (see below), and posting results to
mailing list too.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

From tarball:

$ ./configure [configure options]
$ make [-jN]

From git checkout:

$ ./autogen.sh [configure options]
$ make [-jN]

See the available configure options:

$ ./configure --help
or
$ ./autogen.sh --help

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

CFEngine might be installed in two configurations:

 * (default) Native CFEngine file layout. Everything is installed in
   /var/cfengine, laid out as a "secondary FHS root". This layout is designed to
   keep CFEngine running even if most of the system is broken (e.g. /usr is not
   mounted due to NFS breakage).

* FHS file layout, enabled by --enable-fhs. This layout follows FHS 2.3.

After the build process has completed (see BUILD INSTRUCTIONS above), type:

$ make install

RUNNING TESTSUITE
-----------------

Please refer to the instructions in tests/README file.

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
--------------------

Here we have examples of command lines for various systems to install dependencies
needed to build. The version and date checked are noted in parenthesis. Please
submit PRs with updates to this information.
