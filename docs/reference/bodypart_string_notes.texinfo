In cfengine previously lists were represented (as in the shell) using
separted scalars, e.g. like the PATH variable. This design feature
turned out to be an error of judgement which has resulted in much
trouble. This is no longer supported in cfengine 3. By keeping lists
an independent type many limitations have been removed.
