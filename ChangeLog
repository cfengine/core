3.4.0

	New features:

	- Added rpmvercmp utility to compare versions of RPM packages for
	  accurate sorting of RPM packages for packages promises.

	- Implement network timeout on server side to avoid keeping stale
	  connections for hours.

	- XML editing capabilities. See the documentation for edit_xml
	  body. Note the new dependency: libxml2.

	- Implement inheritance of local classes by bundles called using
	  "usebundle". By default classes are not inherited. See the
	  examples/unit_inherit.cf for an example.

	- Moved from Nova/Enterprise:
	  - POSIX ACL support,
	  - "outputs" promise type,
	  - remote syslog support.

	- packages_default_arch_command hook in packages promises, to
	  specify default architecture of the packages on the system.

	- packages_version_less_command / packages_version_equal_command hooks
	  in packages promises, to specify external command for native package
	  manager versions comparison

	- agent_expireafter in body executor control allows you to set a
	  timeout on all cf-agent runs, to enforce a threshold on the
	  number of concurrent agents

	- Running in Solaris zone is now detected and classes "zone" and
	  "zone_<name>" are created in this case.

	- VirtualBox support added to guest_environment promises.

	- guest_environment promises are supported under OS X.

	- The "depends_on" attribute is now active, for the partal ordering
	  of promises. If a promise depends on another (referred by handle)
	  it will only be considered if the depends_on list is either kept
	  or repaired already.

	  ** WARNING: When upgrading, make sure that any existing use
	              of depends_on does not make some promises being
	              unintentionally ignored. This can happen if you are
	              currently refering to non-existant or never-run handles
	              in depends_on attributes.

	- methods return values, initial implementation

	- New format for cf-key -s, includes timestamp of last connection

	- cf-promises --parse-tree option to parse policy file and dump it
	  in JSON format

	- Namespaces support for bundles and bodies. See the
	  examples/unit_namespace*.cf for the usage.

	- Default arguments for bundles. See the examples/unit_defaults.cf

	- Metadata promise type. See the examples/unit_meta.cf

	New semantics:

	- Methods promises now return the status of promises
	  kept within them. If any promise was not kept, the method is not
	  kept, else if any promise is repaired, the method was repaired
	  else it was kept.
	- Remote variable access in namespaces by $(namespace:bundle.variable)

	Changed functionality:

	- cf-execd -F switch no longer implies 'run once'. New -O/--once
	  option is added to achieve this behaviour. This makes cf-execd
	  easier to run from systemd, launchd and other supervision
	  systems.

	Misc:

	- Support for the following outdated platforms and corresponding
	  classes has been removed. De facto those platforms were
	  unsupported for a long time, as CFEngine codebase uses C99
	  language features unavailable on old platforms:

	   - SunOS 3.x (sun3)
	   - SunOS 4.x (sun4)
	   - Ultrix (ultrix)
	   - DEC OSF/1 AXP (osf)
	   - Digital UNIX (digital)
	   - Sony NEWS (newsos)
	   - 4.3BSD (bsd4_3)
	   - IRIX (irix, irix4, irix64)
	   - IBM Academic Operating System (aos)
	   - BSD/OS / BSDi / BSD/386 (bsdos)
	   - NeXTSTEP (nextstep)
	   - GNU Hurd (gnu)
	   - NEC UX/4800 (ux4800)

	- (Old news) Since 3.3.0 the layout of CFEngine Community packages
	  has changed slightly.

	  cf-* binaries have been moved to /var/cfengine/bin, due to the
	  following reasons:

	   - cf-* binaries are linked to libraries installed to
	     /var/cfengine/lib, so placing binaries in /usr/local/sbin does not
	     increase reliability of the CFEngine,

	   - keeping whole CFEngine under single prefix (/var/cfengine)
	     makes packaging simpler,

	   - it matches the layout of CFEngine Enterprise packages.

	   Please adjust your policies (the recommended ways to deal with
	   the move are either to adjust $PATH to include /var/cfengine or to
	   create symlinks in /usr/local/sbin in case you are relying on
	   binaries to be available in $PATH).

	- Workdir location is properly changed if --prefix or --enable-fhs
	  options are supplied to configure (Mantis #1195).

	- Added check for broken libmysqlclient implementations (Mantis #1217).

	- Standard library is updated from COPBL repository.

	- cf-know is no longer built in Community releases. The only
	  functionality useful in Community, namely the reference manual
	  generation, is provided by new compile-time cf-gendoc tool.

    - Filename (for storing filechanges) changed
      from file_change.log -> file_changes.log (in /var/cfengine/state)

      New format for storing file changes introduced:
      [timestamp,filename,<N/C/S/R>,Message]

      N = New file found
      C = Content Changed
      S = Stats changed
      R = File removed

	- Acceptance test suite passes on Mac OS X.

	- Changed some port numbers to replace old services with imap(s)

	- archlinux hard class on Arch Linux.

	- Detect BSD Make and automatically switch to GNU Make during build.

	Bugfixes:

	- cfruncommand for cf-execd is an arbitrary shell command now (Mantis #1268).
	- Fixed broken "daily" splayclasses (Mantis #1307).
	- Allow filenames up to 4096 bytes in network transfers (Redmine #1199).
	- Fix stale state preserved during cf-serverd reload (Redmine #1487).
	- Free disk space calculation is fixed (Mantis #1120).
	- Numerous portability bugfixes (especially OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX-related).
	- Compatibility fixes for AIX, HP-UX, Solaris (Mantis #1185, Mantis #1177, Mantis #1109).
	- Fixed broken socklen_t configure check under OpenBSD (Mantis #1168).
	- Fixed hang in cf-promises under OpenBSD (Mantis #1113).
	- Fixed endless loop in evaluating "$()" construct (Mantis #1023).
	- Fixed check for old PCRE versions (Mantis #1262).
	- Fixed insertion of multi-line blocks at the start of file (Mantis #809).
	- Fixed numerous memory leaks.
	- Fixes for metadata that were not resolvable
	- Fixes for namespaces that would not support metadata and variable expansion
	- Point-to-point network interfaces are detected and reported by CFEngine (Mantis #1246)
	- Partial non-GNU userspace support in acceptance testsuite (Mantis #1255)

	Full list of issues fixed is available on
	https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php (old bug tracker)
	and https://cfengine.com/dev/projects/core/versions/34 (new bug tracker)

3.3.4   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Fix wrong classes set after installation of several packages
	  using packages promises (Mantis #829).
	- Fix segfault using edit_template on existing file (Mantis #1155).

	Misc:

	- Fix memory leak during re-read of network interfaces'
	  information in cf-execd/cf-serverd.

3.3.3   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Zero-length files are valid for readfile() and similar functions
	  (Mantis #1136).
	- Unchoke agent in case it encounters symlinks in form ./foo
	  (Similar to Mantis #1117).

	Misc:

	- Fix generation of reference manual on machines with umask more
	  relaxed than 022.
	- Use statvfs(3) on OpenBSD to obtain filesystem information
	  (Mantis #1135).

3.3.2   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Do not segfault if file copy was interrupted due to network
	  connectivity or server going away (Mantis #1089).
	- Do not segfault if log_failed attribute is present in body, but
	  log_kept is not (Mantis #1107).
	- Do not mangle relative paths in symlinks during file copy
	  Previously symlink a -> b was mangled to a -> ./b.
	  (Mantis #1117)
	- Properly compare 1.0 and 1.0.1 in packages promises. Previously
	  only versions with equal amount of "segments" were comparable
	  (Mantis #890, #1066).

	Base policy:

	- Properly set permissions on files for /var/cfengine/lib on HP-UX
	  (Mantis #1114).
	- Standard library (cfengine_stdlib.cf) is synced with COPBL
	  repository.

	Misc:

	- Do not create huge file in case corrupted TokyoCabinet database
	  is detected (Mantis #1106).
	- Fix file descriptor leak on error paths, may have caused crashes
	  of cf-execd and cf-serverd (Issue #1096).
	- Fix intermittent segfault in cf-execd (Mantis #1116).
	- Impose an upper limit on amount of listening sockets reported by
	  cf-monitord. Huge amounts of listening sockets caused cf-agent to
	  segfault on next run (Mantis #1098).
	- Add missing function prototypes caused errors during compilation
	  on HP-UX (Mantis #1109).
	- Fix compilation on Solaris 11 (Mantis #1091).

3.3.1   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Do not cut off name of bundle in variables interpolation (Mantis #975).
	- Do not segfault in function evaluation guarded by ifvaclass clause (Mantis #1084, #864).
	- Do not segfault if "classes" promise does not declare any value to be evaluated (Mantis #1074).
	- Do not segfault in database promises if there is no
	    database_operation provided (Mantis #1046).

	Built-in functions:

	- Fix countclassesmatching() function which was misbehaving trying
	    to match classes starting with alphanumeric symbol (Mantis #1073).
	- Fix diskfree() to return kilobytes, as described in documentation (Mantis #980, #955).
	- Fix hostsseen() function to avoid treating all hosts as not
	    being seen since 1970 (Mantis #886).
	- Do not output misleading error message if readtcp() is unable to connect (Mantis #1085).

	Command-line interface:

	- -d option previously reqired an argument, though help message disagreed (Mantis #1053).
	- Disable --parse-tree option, not ready for the release (Mantis #1063).
	- Acept -h as a --help option.
	- Ensure that cf-execd might be started right after being shut down.

	Misc:

	- Plug file descriptor leak after failed file copy (Mantis #990).
	- Fix unsafe admit rules in default promises.cf (Mantis #1040).
	- Fix splaytime to match documentation: it is specified in minutes, not seconds (Mantis #1099).

	Packaging:

	- Fix owner/group of initscript and profile.d snippet in RPM builds (Mantis #1061, #1058).
	- Fix location of libvirt socket CFEngine uses to connect to libvirtd (Mantis #1072).
	- Install CoreBase to /var/cfengine/masterfiles during installation (Mantis #1075).
	- Do not leave old cf-twin around after upgrade (Mantis #1068)
	- Do not leave rcS.d symlinks after purging .deb package (Mantis #1092).

3.3.0

	New promise types:
	- Guest environments promises, which allow to manipulate virtual
	  machines using libvirt.
	- Database promises, which allow to maintain schema of MySQL and
	  PostgreSQL databases. Database promises are in "technical preview"
	  status: this promise type is subject to change in future.
	- Services promises for Unix, allows abstraction of details
	  on managing any service

	New built-in functions:
	- dirname() to complement lastnode()
	- lsdir()
	- maplist() to apply functions over lists

	New features:
	- Allow defining arrays from modules.
	- Allow both `process_stop' and `signals' constraints in
	  `processes' promises at the same time.
	- cf-promises --gcc-brief-format option to output warnings and
	  errors in gcc-compatible syntax which to ease use "go to next
	  error" feature of text editors.
	- Iteration over lists is now allowed for qualified (non-local) lists.

	New built-in variables and classes (Linux):
	- Number of CPUs: $(sys.cpus), 1_cpu, 2_cpus etc

	New built-in variables and classes (Unices):
	- $(sys.last_policy_update) - timestamp when last policy change was seen by host
	- $(sys.hardware_addresses) - list of MAC adresses
	- $(sys.ip_addresses) - list of IP addresses
	- $(sys.interfaces) - list of network interfaces
	- $(sys.hardware_mac[$iface]) - MAC address for network interface
	- mac_<mac_address>:: - discovered MAC addresses

	Changes:

	- Major cleanup of database handling code. Should radically decrease
	  amount of database issues experienced under heavy load.

	  *WARNING*: Berkeley DB and SQLite backends are *removed*, use
	  Tokyo Cabinet or QDBM instead. Both Tokyo Cabinet and QDBM are
	  faster than Berkeley DB in typical CFEngine workloads.

	  Tokyo Cabinet requires C99 environment, so it should be
	  available on every contemporary operating system.

	  For the older systems QDBM, which relies only on C89, is a
	  better replacement, and deemed to be as portable, as Berkeley DB.

	- Change of lastseen database schema. Should radically decrease
	  I/O contention on lasteen database.

	- Automatic reload of policies by cf-execd.
	- Documentation is generated during build, PDF and HTML files are
	  retired from repository.
	- Rarely used feature retired: peer connectivity intermittency calculation.
	- Memory and CPU usage improvements.
	- Testsuite now uses 'make check' convention and does not need root
	  privileges anymore.
	- cf_promises_validated now filled with timestamp, allows digest-copy
	  for policy instead of mtime copy which is safer when clocks are unsynchronised
	- The bundled failsafe.cf policy now has trustkey=false to avoid IP spoofing
	  attacks in default policy
	- See the full list of bugfixes at
	  https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php

	version is larger than currently installed - updates only if so

	Help text of cf-report -r corrected - a list of key hashes is
	required, not ip addresses.

	New Emacs mode for CFEngine policy files (thanks to Ted Zlatanov!)

	Warnings are on edit_line changes can now give greater degree of information
	without spamming promise logs

	packages.

	New option cf-key -r to remove host key by IP or hostname.

	Added detection of network interfaces which belong to BSD jails.

	Improve robustness of multi-threaded code, in particular fix
	problems with spurious acces denials in server and losing of
	authentication rules after policy reload.

	cf-promises accepts option -b matching cf-agent, which causes it
	to do not complain about missing bundlesequence.

	New functions and(), not(), or() and concat() to ease use of
	ifvarclass() clause.

	Full list of issues fixed is available on
	https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php

3.1.5
	New class parser, '||' is no longer allowed in expressions (use '|').

	Class setting in the promise types insert_lines, delete_lines,
	replace_patterns, field_edits, vars, classes is restored.

	suspiciousnames implemented.

	New function getvalues().

	New functions parse{read,int,string}array to match read{read,int,string}array.

	Testsuite added to check for core functionality.

	Syslog prefix is fixed to say 'cf3' instead of 'community'.

3.1.4	(Bugfix and Stability release)

	Some urgent patches to 3.1.3.
	Class validation parse bug fixed.
	Global zone handling error for solaris fixed.
	Package architectures handled correctly (bug #456).
	Reading and writing of key name "root-.pub" eliminated (bug #442, #453).
	cf-serverd crash because of race condition on SERVER_KEYSEEN fixed.
	Lock purging to avoid remnant complexity explosion (bug #430).
	Some copyright notices added that got lost.

3.1.3   (Stability release)

	Major memory leaks in cf-monitord, cf-execd, cf-serverd fixed (bug #427).
	The daemons now show no growth even with very complex policies.

	cf-serverd crash due to race condition in DeleteScope() fixed (bug #406).

	Added 30 second timeout on recv() on Linux.

	package_noverify_returncode implemented (bug #256).

	A flexible mechanism for setting classes based on return codes of
	commands has been introduced. Allows for setting promise kept,
	repaired or failed based on any return codes. This is currently
	implemented for commands-promises, package-manager commands and
	transformer in files. In classes body, see attributes
	kept_returncodes, repaired_returncodes, failed_returncodes (bug
	#248, #329).

	New function ip2host - reverse DNS lookup (bug #146).

3.1.2   (Scalability/efficiency release)

	Big efficiency improvements by caching output from
	cf-promises. Can also be used for much more efficent policy
	deployment (only pull if changed).

	Caching state of ps command for greater efficiency. Reloaded for each bundle.

	Index class lookup improves efficiency of class evaluation for huge configurations.

        Fixed issue where certain promiser strings got corrupted.

	cf-key -s command for showing key hash/IP address identity pairs

3.1.0
	Change in storage of public keys. Cfengine now hashes the public key and uses this
	as the keyname. Keys will be converted automatically.

	The old dynamic addresses lists are deprecated.
	Caching of dns and key information for greater server speed.
	Change in last-seen format reflects the public key usage.

	New package policy addupdate - installs package if not there and
	updates it otherwise.

	Support for package_changes => "bulk" in file repository as well.

	New special function readstringarrayidx, similar to readstringarray,
	but uses integer indeces. Very useful if first row elements are
	not good identifiers (e.g. contains spaces, non-unique, etc.).

	Change two log formats to use time() instead of date()
	- filechanges
	- total compliance

	Change from using md5 to sha256 as default digest for commercial version,
	community retains md5 for compat.

	Commands not returning 0 in commands-promises are flagged
	as repair_failed.

	Adjustable timeout on connect(). Defaults to 10 seconds, adjustable
	with default_timeout in agent control.

	Redesign of the knowledge map infrastructure.

	Now possible to use variables to call methods, e.g

	methods:

	  "name $(list)" usebundle => $(list)("abc");

	See reference manual notes

	Changes to normal ordering to optimize execution.

	Increased stability by always initializing Attribute and Promise
	structures.

	When running cf-promises in dry-run mode (-n), the user does not need
	to put binaries in WORKDIR/bin. For example, non-privileged users can verify root
	policies.

	Source control revision added in version string if run in verbose mode
	(e.g. "cf-promises -vV"). This needs some refining, uses revision of a header now.

	New semantics in return values of list functions. Null values are now allowed
	and there is no iteration over empty lists. The value "cf_null" is reserved for
	use as a null iterator.

3.0.5p1
        Showing paths allowed/denied access to when cf-serverd is run in verbose mode.
	Bug in server fixed for dynamic addresses.
	File handle closure bugfix - too many open databases.
	Seg fault in mount files fix.
	Twin used in cf-execd without checking.
	Check_root set wrong directory permissions at source not destination.
	Error message degraded in body definition.
	Undefined body not warned as error.
	Various build enahncements.
	Package_list_update called only once per manager, and fixed crash.
	Version number bug in packages.

3.0.5
        Encryption problems fixed - client key buffer was uninitialized.

        Classes-promisers are now automatically canonified when class
	strings are defined, to simplifying the use of variables in classes.

        New scalars sys.cf_version and sys.nova_version that hold Cfengine version information.

        Attribute package_delete_convention added, to allow customizable
	package name in delete command during update.

	package_list_update_ifelapsed limit added.

	Private variable $(firstrepo) is available in package_name_convention
        and package_delete_convention in order to expand the full path to
	a package, which is required by some managers.

	Some of the threading code is rewritten and made more robust. This includes
     	synchronizing access to the lastseen database from the server.

        Bad initialization of BSD flags fixed
	Multiple variable expansion issues in control fixed for server and agent
	Allow ignore_missing_bundles to affect methods: bundles too
	Run agent trust dialogue fixed

	Bug in CPU monitoring, increasing time scale caused linear decay
	of CPU measurement.

	Bug in Setuid log storage, fix.

	Hooks added for new Nova virtualization promises.

	Multithreading mutex failed to collide during cfservd leading to dropped authentication under heavy load.


3.0.4
	Class cancellation in promises to create better class feedback,
	allows emulation of switch/case semantics etc

	Value of SA measurement promises

	Special function getenv() which returns the contents of an
	environment variable (on all platforms).
	New function translatepath for generic Windows
	New function escape() to escape literals as regular expressions (like SQL)
        New function host2ip for caching IP address lookup
	New function regextract for setting variables with backreferences

	New variables for the components $(sys.cf_agent), $(sys.cf_know) etc
	pointing to the binaries.

	More robust integrated database implementation; closing all
	handles when receiving signals, self-healing on corruption.

	Package installation on localhost without a manager like yum completed,
	multiple repositories searched, and universal methods.

	Numerous bugfixes


3.0.3
	sha256 .. new hashes in openssl included in syntax tree.

	End of line autocropping in readfile (hopefully intelligent)

	hashmatch function incorrectly implemented - old debugging code left behind. Fix.

	sys.crontab variable

	Unknown user is now interpretated as "same user", so that we give cfengine a chance to
	fix

	Unregistered addresses no longer report "(Non registered IP)", but return as the address
	itself when doing reverse lookups.

3.0.2
	IMPORTANT: Change in normal ordering of editing. replace comes
	after insert lines Much testing and minor bug fixing

	Memory leaks fixed
	Many hooks added for Nova enterprise extensions.

        promise_output reports now placed in WORKDIR/reports directory

	Initialization correction and self-correx in monitord

	Many new body constraints added.

	Code readied for enterprise version Nova.

	-b option can override the bundlesequence (must not contain parameters yet)

	collapse_destination_dir option added to copy so that files can be
	aggregated from subdirectories into a single destination.
