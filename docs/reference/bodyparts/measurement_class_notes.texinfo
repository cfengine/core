By setting this string you switch on performance measurement for the
current promise, and also give the measurement a name. The identifier forms a
partial identity for optional performance scanning of promises of the form:

@example
@var{ID:promise-type:promiser}.
@end example

These can be seen identifying  using @code{cf-report}, e.g. in the
generated file @file{performance.html}.
