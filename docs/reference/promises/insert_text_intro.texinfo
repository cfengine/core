This promise is part of the XML-editing model. It assures that a
value string, containing the matching substring, will be present
in the specified node within the XML file. If the substring is not
found, the default promise is to append the substring at the end of
the existing value string, within the specified node. The specified
node is determined by body-attributes. The promise object referred
to is a literal string of text.
