This is a list of promise handles for whom this promise is a
promisee. In other words, we acknowledge that this promise will be
affected by the list of promises whose handles are specified.

It has the effect of partially ordering promises.

As of version 3.4.0, promise this feature is active and may be
considered a short-hand for setting classes. If one promise depends on
a list of others, it will not be verified unless the dependent
promises have already been verified and kept: i.e. as long as the
dependent promises are either kept or repaired the dependee can be
verified.

Handles in other namespaces may be referred to by @var{namespace.handle}.
