# Reachable bundle tests verify that you are allowed have references
# to undefined bundles, as long as they are not actually called.

# These tests are left very simple on purpose,
# they are not using the test framework.
# They should be seen together, note that defined vs undefined variants are
# almost identical, just replacing one detail to show what should work
# and what should error.

# reversed tests are just to show it should behave the same
# if the called bundle comes after instead of before

bundle agent main
{
  methods:
    "foo"
      usebundle => bar("baz"); # Should error because bar does not exist
}

bundle agent foo(x)
{
  # foo exists, but it's not the bundle we are looking for
  reports:
    "$(x)";
    "$(this.promise_filename) Pass";
}
