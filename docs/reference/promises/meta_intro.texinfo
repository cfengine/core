Meta-data promises have no internal function. They are intended to be
used to represent arbitrary information about promise
bundles. Formally, meta promises are implemented as variables, and the
values map to a variable context called @var{bundlename_meta}, and
therefore the values can be used as variables and will appear in
Enterprise variable reports.
