The first named group is the list is the defaul that will be
configured if the file does not match an element of the list.  The
reserved word @samp{none} may be used to match files that are not
owned by a registered group. On windows, files do not have file groups
associated with them and thus this attribute is ignored.

ACLs may be used in place for this.
