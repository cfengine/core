@chapter Introduction

CFEngine 3 Nova is a commercially licensed version of the core CFEngine
software@footnote{Major version 3} with enterprise library extensions. All of
the documentation for CFEngine 3 applies to CFEngine 3 Nova. 

The aim of CFEngine 3 Nova is to offer a knowledge-enhanced framework for configuration man-
agement that goes beyond mere technical configuration to support the needs of businesses. Features
include compliance management, reporting and business integration, and tools for handling necessary
complexity. CFEngine 3 Nova has features to support Cloud Computing for public and private clouds, as
well as greater integration facilities with database resources.

@c This document describes installation, features, and first steps in using CFEngine 3 Nova.

@section Hardware requirements

The default CFEngine 3 Nova architecture uses a single hub, or policy server, to publish changes of policy
and to aggregate knowledge about the environment, but you can set up as many as you like to manage
different parts of your organization independently. The CFEngine technology is not centralized by
nature. Most users choose to centralize updating of policy and report aggregation for convenience
however.

The default architecture and configuration skeleton of CFEngine 3 Nova is expected to scale to a few thousand hosts with a
dedicated policy hub. In such a case, your hub machine should have at least 2 GB of memory and a modern processor.
For machines under CFEngineâ€™s management (clients), a full installation of CFEngine 3 Nova requires about 20 MB of disk storage. Otherwise disk usage depends on your specific policies, especially those that concern reporting. Each software component (agent) typically uses under 10 MB of memory, but spikes in memory usage can occur if several agents run simultaneously. CFEngine recommends to have 256 MB available memory on the clients.


@c --------------------------------------------------
@node  Operating system support,  , Hardware requirements, Requirements
@section Operating system support

CFEngine can be made to run on most operating systems. For efficiency
CFEngine only supports a number of recent popular operating systems,
which should be up to date with patches. If we don't have packages for
your particular operating systems we can usually make packages by
special arrangement.

The hub (policy server) is only available for derivatives of the
top GNU/Linux distributions (Debian, Red Hat, SuSE, Ubuntu), as these make available
software that the hub relies on for data storage and processing.
Operating system choices for the hub are:

@example
 Debian 5,6
 Ubuntu 8,10
 RHEL/CentOS 5,6
 SLES/openSuSE   11
@end example

Nova provides a version of CFEngine running natively on Windows, with
support for registry management, Windows services and file
security, @xref{Windows-specific features in Nova}. Support for Solaris zones has been added through
automated zone detection and process model adaptation.

A working package manager is required on the hub/policy server to install an Apache Web Server, php module, MongoDB, subversion, etc. You should start from a blank system (i.e. with none of these components installed) to avoid potential interference with the installation process. No special software is otherwise required on machines in your network, CFEngine bundles all critical dependencies in the Nova package.

@node Installation procedure, Troubleshooting, Installing CFEngine 3 Nova, Installing CFEngine 3 Nova
@section Installation procedure

CFEngine 3 Nova is designed to be simple to install in its default configuration. The installation
process has three phases:

@itemize
@item Unpacking the software.
@item Obtaining a license.
@item Adapting policy.
@end itemize

You should start from a blank system @xref{Hardware requirements}. If you have been using CFEngine Community Edition and you have
already developed a policy, set aside this policy during the installation process. You will be able
to integrate it back later.

Nova is provided in two packages, @file{cfengine-nova} and @file{cfengine-nova-expansion}. The main software package 
must be installed on every host (including the hub). The expansion package is only installed on the policy hub. You should install and set up the hub first.

References to package managers assume that additional packages might need to be installed on the hub (policy server). Root privilege is required for the installation.

@enumerate
@item Verify that the machine's network connection is working and that port 5308 is open for both incoming and outgoing connections (to assure communication between the hub and clients). On the hub, verify that package managers @code{yum},
@code{zypper} or @code{apt-get} are working. They will be used to
install a web server, database, php server and subversion. If you are not able to set up a package manager and
repository on the hub, please @xref{Frequently Asked Questions}, for manual installation.

@item Copy the Nova packages to the system. On the hub (policy server):
@example
cfengine-nova_2.1.@var{xxx.[rpm|deb]}
cfengine-nova-expansion_2.1.@var{xxx.[rpm|deb]}
@end example
@noindent On all other machines:
@example
cfengine-nova_2.1.@var{xxx.[rpm|deb]}
@end example

@item Unpack the software:
@table @i
@item Red Hat family
@example
host# rpm -ihv @var{packages}
@end example

@item SUSE family
@example
host# rpm -ihv @var{packages}
@end example

@item Debian family
@example
host# dpkg --install  @var{packages}
@end example

@end table 

@item On the hub, a public key has now been created in @file{/var/cfengine/ppkeys/localhost.pub} as part of the
package installation. You should send this public key to CFEngine Support@footnote{You will obtain credentials to the CFEngine Support ticketing system and software download repository as a part of your purchase.} as an attachment in the ticket system, 
to obtain a license file @file{license.dat}. 

@cartouche
Save the returned license file to @file{/var/cfengine/masterfiles/license.dat} 
on the hub before continuing.
@end cartouche

 See more details for the software licensing here; 
@url{https://cfengine.com/software/Licensing.pdf}

@item The remaining steps apply to all hosts, but you should install the hub or policy server first. For large systems (> 1000 hosts) we recommend increasing the memory limit in php.ini on the hub (for instance to 128 MB).

Find the hostname or IP address of the hub (policy server), here we assume @samp{123.456.789.123} is the address.
@verbatim
 hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
@end verbatim
Use the same command on all hosts, i.e. *** do not bootstrap the policy server with a localhost address *** 
If you mistype the address of the hub, we recommend doing the following steps to re-boostrap.
@verbatim
 hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.124
 hub # killall cf-execd cf-serverd cf-monitord cf-hub
 hub # rm -rf /var/cfengine/inputs/*
 hub # rm -f /var/cfengine/policy_server.dat
 hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
@end verbatim

CFEngine will output diagnostic information upon bootstrap (written to command line and syslog; cf-agent will also return a value: ERROR: 1, SUCCESS: 0). Error messages will be displayed if bootstrapping failed, pursue these to get an indication of what went wrong and correct accordingly. If all is well you should see the following in the output:

@verbatim

-> Bootstrap to 123.456.789.123 completed successfully

@end verbatim

@item CFEngine should now be up and running on your system. It will copy its default policy files into @file{masterfiles} on the hub (policy server) provided that the directory is empty (fresh install). When the clients are bootstrapped, they will contact the hub and copy them to their @file{inputs} directory.

@item To complete licensing setup, you should make a promise to accept the license
terms by editing @file{/var/cfengine/masterfiles/promises.cf}
on the hub (policy server), changing the line @samp{host_licenses_paid => "<NUMBER>";}
in @samp{body common control} to reflect the correct number of licenses that you have subscribed to.

@end enumerate

@noindent @b{How to assess success in this procedure:}

@enumerate

@item Look at the process list on the systems with @samp{ps waux | grep cf-}.
You should be able to see @code{cf-execd} running, and eventually other processes from 
the CFEngine suite like @code{cf-monitord} @code{cf-serverd}. On the hub, you should 
also eventually see @code{cf-hub}. Note that it may take 5--10 minutes before all the
processes get started.

@item Look for files in @file{/var/cfengine/inputs} (Unix)
or @file{C:\Program Files\Cfengine\inputs} (Windows). The license
file will be copied out from the policy server to the clients as part
of the normal distribution of policy. Each machine should get a
copy of the @file{license.dat} file in @file{/var/cfengine/inputs}
(Unix) or @file{C:\Program Files\Cfengine\inputs} (Windows).

@item On the hub, the file @file{/var/cfengine/promise_knowledge.cf} should have been
created, and should contain data.

@item  Finally, try to connect to the web server at port 80 on the hub/policy host (for example at http://123.456.789.123).
You should see a login page like the one shown in the figure below:

@sp 1
@center @image{img-login,5cm,,Mission Portal login}
@center Figure: Mission Portal login screen
@sp 1

@noindent Default user name and password is 'admin' and 'admin' (make sure to change this at first login to prevent unauthorized access; but see also Appendix A on configuration of LDAP).
@end enumerate

Note that some of the displays in the Mission Portal may be blank when you log in just after installation; some reports and graphs are only updated every six hours. It may also take some time for the system to fully converge, do not get troubled if initially there are some promises repaired or not kept.

@c @end menu

@c @node How do I install the prerequisites for the hub manually?,  , Frequently Asked Questions, Frequently Asked Questions
@subsection How do I install the prerequisites for the hub manually?

See INSTALLATION.TXT (can be found on the CFEngine software download page: @url{https://cfengine.com/software/}) for a list of dependencies for the hub. 

To install the packages you might want to use @code{yum} on Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora, 
@code{zypper} on SUSE or @code{apt} on Debian/Ubuntu.


@c ----------------------------------------------------
@subsection Why do I get a promise failed with the message @code{Can't stat
/var/cfengine/master_software_updates/SOME-OS} on some hosts?

There is a built-in promise to automatically upgrade the Nova
binaries. By default, the clients will check for an update package
every time Nova runs. So if the clients find that there is no source
directory to download the files from, the message will be displayed.

To fix the problem, simply create an empty directory mentioned in the
message on the hub.
@verbatim
 hub # mkdir /var/cfengine/master_software_updates/SOME-OS
@end verbatim


@c ----------------------------------------------------
@subsection I did bootstrap the hub @emph{before} obtaining a license file, what should I do?

Four steps need to be followed to correct this minor issue.
@enumerate
@item obtain a working license file and copy it to @file{/var/cfengine/masterfiles}
@verbatim
 hub # cp /tmp/license.dat /var/cfengine/masterfiles
@end verbatim
@item killall Nova running processes
@verbatim
 hub # killall cf-execd cf-serverd cf-monitord cf-hub
@end verbatim
@item wipe out @file{/var/cfengine/inputs }
@verbatim
 hub # rm -rf /var/cfengine/inputs
@end verbatim
@item bootstrap the policy hub
@verbatim
 hub # /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap --policy-server 123.456.789.123
@end verbatim
@end enumerate


@c ----------------------------------------------------
@subsection On my hub, I get messages of connection failures to a database. For example, in @code{messages}, I can see something like @code{!! Could not open connection to report database for saving}. What should I do?, How do I upgrade from CFEngine Community 3 to CFEngine 3 Nova?, 

This message comes from the @code{cf-hub} process. It is responsible
for pulling reports from hosts that have contacted the hub to get
policy updates. When these reports are fetched, they are stored in a local MongoDB database on the hub. This message is produced when there is a failure in the connection to the database.

Probably, the issue is that the database server is not running on your
hub. Run the @code{ps}-command to check this.
@verbatim
 hub # ps -e | grep mongod
@end verbatim

If the @code{mongod} process @emph{is} running, it must be
misconfigured or in some bad state. Please look at the newest entry in
@file{/var/log/mongod.log} to diagnose the problem, and contact
CFEngine Technical Support if necessary.

If the @code{mongod} process @emph{is not} running, please follow the
steps below.

@enumerate
@item Run 
  hub # @code{/var/cfengine/bin/cf-twin -Kvf failsafe.cf > /tmp/cfout}
@item Check again if the @code{mongod} is running, if so, the problem
is probably fixed now.
@item If @code{mongod} is still not running, please search the output
file for lines starting as follows.

@verbatim
...
nova>  -> Making a one-time restart promise for mongod
...
...
nova>  -> Executing '/var/cfengine/bin/mongod....
nova>  -> Backgrounding job /var/cfengine/bin/mongod...
nova>  -> Completed execution of /var/cfengine/bin/mongod...
...
@end verbatim

If you don't see the first line above, Nova does not try to start
@code{mongod} --- so check if you bootstrapped your hub correctly. If
you see all lines, it means that Nova starts @code{mongod}, but the process just
terminates immediately after. If so, continue to the next step.

@item Look at the newest entry in @file{/var/log/mongod.log}. It
should give you more details of why the @code{mongod} process refuses
to start. The two most common scenarios are described next.

@item If @code{mongod} has been terminated unexpectedly, it might have
left a lock-file behind that stops it from starting again. Try
deleting @file{/var/cfengine/state/mongod.lock} if it exists.

@item If the database is corrupted, you can have @file{mongod} create a new one by moving
@file{/var/cfengine/state/cf-report.*} out of the way. There are also
tools and documentation for repairing a database at
@url{http://www.mongodb.org/}.

Note that almost all of the @code{cfreport} database is recreated with data collected from clients. This happens every 5 minutes or 6 hours (depending on the probe), you may consider whether deleting the database is an acceptable solution. CFEngine AS or CFEngine Inc can not be held responsible for data loss in this respect.
@end enumerate


@c ----------------------------------------------------
@subsection How do I upgrade from CFEngine Community 3 to CFEngine 3 Nova?

CFEngine 3 Nova comes with policies that are specific to Nova functionality, we therefore urge you to set aside your
current community policy. Install CFEngine 3 Nova, set up the Nova hub by
following this document, and then integrate your existing
policy to the hub manually, in small testable steps.

CFEngine 3 Nova is compatible with the Community Edition of CFEngine 3, but
some process files are now managed by CFEngine 3 Nova for user convenience.

@chapter Upgrading CFEngine Nova

When upgrading the software from an earlier version, you should
upgrade the hub (policy server) machine first. Any other hosts
in your network that act as servers for encrypted copy operations
would preferably be upgraded next. This is because a stronger form of
encryption-hash is used in newer versions, which the older servers
cannot understand.

CFEngine packages its software in operating system compatible package
formats (RPM, DEB, PKG, MSI, etc). New packages are made available on the
cfengine.com website; these can be downloaded and installed
in the standard way.

@section Upgrade procedure

The following is a general procedure to upgrade to CFEngine 3 Nova from earlier versions. It is assumed that the packages are placed in the @file{/tmp} directory. To upgrade, start with the hub (policy server):

@enumerate
@item Stop all CFE processes
@verbatim
   $ /etc/init.d/cfengine3 stop
or
   $ for i in cf-execd cf-serverd cf-monitord cf-hub mongod; do pkill $i; done

   expansion_2.1.0-5_x86_64.deb
@end verbatim

@item Nova's dependencies have changed so we have to correct cf-twin (libgd and libmysqlclient were removed)
@verbatim
   $ cp /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent /var/cfengine/bin/cf-twin
@end verbatim

@item Remove database lock if present
@verbatim
   $ rm /var/cfengine/state/mongod.lock
@end verbatim

@item Copy the new CFEngine policy files to $(sys.workdir)/masterfiles. The files with a prefix "CFE_" will be handled by CFEngine, do not make changes to these. They are mostly renamed versions of old files (cfengine.cf, knowledge.cf, etc) where some promises have been added to ensure that the Mission Portal will work properly.
@verbatim
   $ cd /var/cfengine/master_software_updates/NovaBase

Using CFEngine classes to select a subset of machines, you can deploy of updates on a small
number of test systems first.

@node  What if I have multiple operating system platforms?, How do Nova policies update if I already have my own policy?, How can I do phased deployment?, Upgrading CFEngine Nova
@section What if I have multiple operating system platforms?

As of version 1.1 of CFEngine Nova, CFEngine will look for updates in an operating specific
location on the policy server. To update a particular operating system, you only need to place
its package in the correct subdirectory and the client host will know where to look.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node How do Nova policies update if I already have my own policy?,  , What if I have multiple operating system platforms?, Upgrading CFEngine Nova
@section How do Nova policies update if I already have my own policy?

New CFEngine package updates will not overwrite your existing policy. That means that they
will also not improve your current updating arrangement without your approval.

@cartouche
If you want to make use of CFEngineâ€™s enhancements to standard policy files like
â€˜update.cfâ€™, you need to examine and integrate these changes to your policy server manually.
Update the software before updating policy, as new policy might require new features in
the software.

The Mission Portal is the centerpiece
of user interaction with CFEngine 3 Nova. It can be accessed by connecting to the hub (policy server) with your web browser (for example at http://123.456.789.123; default port 80). From here you can get a complete overview of operations and performance, business and compliance, organizational knowledge and library.

There are four main rooms in the Mission Portal that offer insight into different aspects of operations:

@itemize -
@item Mission status: a top level overview of compliance status and business value
@item Mission engineering: a place to see the current state of system repair
@item Mission planning: a place to plan and make policy changes

@subsection Mission Status

Mission status is a high level summary of how well the entire system is behaving. 

@sp 1
@image{img-status,15cm,,Mission Status}
@center Figure: The status of IT operations.
@sp 1

Business Value and Host Status:
The two pie charts show the business value of the promises kept/not kept and well as host status, respectively. Business value is associated with the value of promises as defined in policy files. In the Host Status chart, each host represents a slice of the pie and is classified into red, yellow, green and blue according to the level of their compliance. A host is red if less than 80% of its promises are kept, yellow if 20% or more of its promises were repaired and host is now compliant, green if more than 80% of its promises are kept, and blue if there is no contact between the hub and the client host (unreachable).

Compliance Summary:
The row of bar meters shows the compliance (average percentage of promises kept, repaired or not kept) of all registered hosts @footnote{Blue hosts will not appear here} in blocks of 6 hours for the past week. It summarizes performance and anomalous behavior in a simple red (promises not kept), yellow (promises repaired) and green (promises kept) scale. Click on a bar to see which promises were kept/not kept.

Services/Goals:
A summary of Mission goals (as defined in user policy files; these examples are from @file{company_knowledge.cf}). Edit the file in the policy editor (Planning room -> repository), or edit the file in your own text editor, to change these goals.

@noindent @b{Host Status:}
@itemize
@item The hosts are classified into red, yellow, green and blue according to the status of their compliance. A host is red if less than 80% of its promises are kept (> 20% not compliant), yellow if 20% or more of its promises were repaired and host is now compliant (> 20% repaired, now compliant), green if more than 80% of its promises are kept (> 80% compliant), and blue if there is no contact between the hub and the client (host unreachable). Clicking a link produces a list of the hosts in that category:

@itemize -
@item Yellow warning triangle: View the promises not kept on this host
@item Pulse line: View vitals signs (statistics) on this host
@item Red X: Delete this host (host will be deleted from database, but may re-appear if CFEngine is still running on it; see footnote below).@footnote{You have to stop CFEngine on the concerned host before deleting it in the Mission Portal, else the host will contact the hub and re-appear in the database.}
@end itemize

@item Worst available host rank: Display the weakest hosts (that have been in contact with the hub) over the last hour.
@item Hub replication status: Display status of redundant monitoring hubs (if activated).
@end itemize

@sp 1
@noindent @b{Promise compliance summary for reachable hosts:} @*
The row of bar meters shows the compliance (average percentage of promises kept, repaired or not kept) of all registered hosts over the past week, the past day and the past hour. It summarizes performance
and anomalous behavior in a simple red (promises not kept), yellow (promises repaired), and green (promises kept) scale. The "Chng" bar relates to the amount of changes made to files monitored by a CFEngine policy in the last hour (change watch). It is green if no changes have been made. The level of yellow increases as changes occur (but it will never be red).  For the "Seen" bar, CFEngine monitors the average time between connections to the clients; a last seen promise is considered not kept if the hub has not been in touch with a host for said average time plus two standard deviations, repaired for said average time plus the interval between one and two standard deviations, and kept for said average time plus the interval between zero and one standard deviation. The "Anom" bar relates to anomalies and is generated from monitoring data (vitals) for the last week in the following fashion: all observations (over the whole week) that are more than two std deviations away from the average is counted as not kept. They are counted as repaired if the distance is between one and two standard deviations from the average. Otherwise, they are kept & green. 

@sp 1
@noindent @b{Finders:} @*
The Mission Engineering room comes with six finder functions (modules that make it simple and intuitive to browse and search for objects of a particular type, see section on Finders): host, class, promises, reports, summary reports, and CDP (Content Driven Policies) reports.

@subsection Policy editor

The CFEngine 3 Nova Mission Portal provides an editor for working on
CFEngine language. The editor provides syntax high-lighting and look-up to make working
with CFEngine's extensive language easier. There is a tie-in for Subversion version
control repositories; the Mission Portal will prompt you for the path and login credentials. Setup of a subversion repository has to be done separately.

@sp 1
@center @image{img-svncheckout,10cm,,SVN checkout}

The main key commands in the editor Window are:

@table @i
@item Auto completion: Ctrl+Space 
Shows a pop-up menu of possible items. This is context sensitive,
e.g. it also works inside lists (e.g. @code{bsdflags}) to provide
possible values.
@item Undo: Ctrl+Z 
 In Safari, Ctrl-backspace may be used.
@item Redo: Ctrl+Y
Undo an undo operation, i.e. reverse the direction of transaction roll.
@item Indent: TAB
Format a file to a standard indentation.
@end table

Multiple documents appear as tabs along the top of the screen.
@sp 1
@center @image{img-policy-editor,15cm,,Policy Editor}
@center Figure: The Policy Editor
@sp 1

The CFEngine 3 Nova policy editor detects syntax errors and highlights
these in red to avoid mistakes when editing.  In addition, by using
the @code{Check syntax} button, it is possible to pre-test the policy
before committing changes to a repository. This will run
@code{promises.cf} through the @code{cf-promises} parser.

The main menu on the left hand panel shows the main work flow items for
policy editing. Clicking the arrow in the panel divider collapses the
menu and gives full-screen editing.

The right hand panel shows basic file and Subversion commands. The @code{Save} button will store a local/version of the opened files without committing to the repository. 


@node Integration with subversion,  , Policy editor, Editors
@subsection Integration with subversion

The default architecture proposes to work in close dialog with a version
repository. CFEngine recommends the use of such a repository and currently
supports subversion.

For the moment, user management in the Mission Portal only concerns access to the Mission Portal settings. It does not affect the ability to edit or approve policies in the policy editor. Access control and authorization for policies are handled by
subversion's authentication system so that edits made in the Mission
Portal can be interleaved with edits from other sources.  The
subversion repository thus becomes the centerpiece of the distributed
coordination, as is the intended function of version control systems. 

When working with a subversion repository, you first do a
''checkout''. This allows you to select the repository you want to
download and creates a working environment based on it. Note that the
editor currently only views files in the checked out repository, so if
you have a directory hierarchy, you need to check out multiple
times. After doing a checkout, you can view the path to the current
repository at the top.

@c @sp 1
@c @center @image{editor-svnpath,6cm,,Path to the current repository}
@c @center Figure: Path to the current repository.
@c @sp 1

The ''update'' command downloads the newest files from the already checked
out subversion repository, while ''commit'' updates the repository
with your working copy. After editing you may or may not commit changes. When closing an
edited file, you are also given the option to commit at once. You also have the ability to see the
repository log of the 20 last changes; this includes changed files,
users and log messages. 

@c @sp 1
@c @center @image{savefiledlg,6cm,,The front page}
@c @center Figure: Save file with repository commit
@c @sp 1
The menu choice to commit a current version commits all files in the
configuration repository. Commits require a mandatory comment. CFEngine recommends
you use this to explain why a change was made, or relate it to an incident number, etc.
The details of @i{what} was changed are already documented by the version control
logs.

Per default there are no automatic updates from the subversion repository to masterfiles as users may want to review changes before they go live. You would either need to copy new policies manually to @file{/var/cfengine/masterfiles} on the hub, or check out your subversion repository there and run svn update. It is however possible to set up automatic updates using CFEngine, for example by adding the following to your policy:

@verbatim
commands:

@subsection Role-Based Access Control
CFEngine Nova 2.2.0 introduces Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for all
reports and promises shown in the Mission Portal. This does not cover
access control for making policy changes, but displaying reports.

RBAC can be globally switched on or off in the Mission Portal settings.

User-authentication is carried out when users log in to the Mission
Portal, see the section on user administration for more details on this.

The information a user is authorized to see is determined from his
role memberships. A user may be member of an arbitrary number of
roles, each which may grant and deny access to certain
information. 

The effective permissions of a user is the cumulative set of
permission granted or denied by his roles, and is used to filter the
information displayed in the following standard way.

@itemize
@item Create a union of the granted access for the roles.
@item Override with the rules that deny access for the roles.
@item If left unspecified, access is denied.
@end itemize

@subsubsection Entities filtered

RBAC is supported on the @emph{host} and @emph{promise bundle} level,
each applying to different parts of the Mission Portal. Both these
entities are atomic with respect to RBAC --- either a user can see
everything they contain, or nothing of it.

Access to a host is required to see any information about it, e.g. all
its reports (Engineering->Reports), host page, and compliance
category. If a user is not allowed access to a host, the Mission
Portal would look the same as if the host was not bootstrapped to that
hub.

Information about the running policy is also available in the Mission
Portal, either through the Promise Finder at the Engineering page, or
by clicking a promise handle from one of the reports. The searchable
promises in the Promise Finder and information pages about promises
and bundles are filtered in the same manner as the hosts, but defined
based on promise bundles instead. The Policy Editor is not covered by
RBAC --- access to the policy source repository allows the user to see
the whole policy. Some version control systems can be configured to
only allow users to access sub-directories of the policy, which may
help in this case.

Note that the host and promise filtering is independent --- no attempt
is made to try to infer which promises a role should have access to
based on the hosts it has access to or vice versa.

@subsubsection Defining roles

From the above discussion, we see that a role is defined as reporting
access to a set of hosts and promise bundles from the Mission Portal
and REST API. This does not give any rights with respect to changing
the content or execution of the policy. It should not be confused with
the @code{roles} promise-type that can be used by @code{cf-runagent}
and @code{cf-serverd}.

In order to scale, both entities are
defined as a set of @emph{regular expressions} to allow and
deny.

Access to hosts is defined by regular expressions on @emph{classes},
not the hostname, ip, or any other name. This is done to ensure
maximum scalability. Classes can be arbitrarily defined in the
CFEngine policy language, so this incurs no loss of flexibility, but
ensures distributed computation.

In contrast to users, a role definition and membership can only be
obtained from the internal Mission Portal database. This means that
any roles must be defined through the Mission Portal web interface,
and can not be obtained from e.g. LDAP at this time. The rationale is
that querying complex LDAP structures for role membership is too
inefficient and error-prone. This may change in future releases, if
requested. Note that the @emph{possible members} of a role can be
obtained from other sources, as described in the section on user
administration. However, assigning possible members to roles must be
done through the Mission Portal user-interface.


@subsubsection Limitations

@itemize

@item Notes added in the Mission Portal are not filtered: they can be
seen by all users (including notes added to any host page).

@item The Knowledge Map is only available for members of the
@samp{admin} role when RBAC is switched on.

@item Running @code{cf-report} from the command-line on the hub will
bypass all RBAC checks.

For the moment, user management in the Mission Portal only concerns access to the Mission Portal settings page. It does not affect the ability to edit or approve policies in the policy editor. Access control and authorization for policies are handled by subversion's authentication system, see section on "Integration with subversion".

On a fresh install the default user "admin" belongs to the "admin" user group and has access to the settings page. Add users and define user groups (Admin, Faculty, Developer, etc.). Alternatively, configure the Mission Portal for use of external authentication (LDAP, Active Directory), see Appendix A. Note that the actual setup of external authentication (definition of users, groups, directory hierarchy, etc.) has to be done independently and is not covered in this document.

The Mission Portal will log php errors, errors related to the configuration of external authentication (LDAP/Active Directory) and occurrences of the fall-back solution if external authentication fails. The log can be found in DOCROOT/application/logs (i.e. @code{/var/www/application/logs} for Ubuntu and @code{/var/www/html/application/logs} for Red Hat). The logs folder must be writable by apache, i.e. by 'www-data' user.

@chapter Monitoring extensions

CFEngine 3 Nova incorporates a lightweight monitoring agent, whose aim
is to provide meaningful performance data about systems, in a scalable
fashion.  CFEngine 3 Nova does not aim to replace specialized
rapid-update monitoring and alarm systems; it provides a context-aware
summary of current state that is always displayed in relation to
previous system behavior, for comparison. The aim is to offer useful
analytics rather than jump-to alarms.

CFEngine's monitoring component @code{cf-monitord} records a number of
performance data about the system by default. These include process
counts, service traffic, load average and CPU utilization and
temperature when available.  In the Community Edition, data are
only collected and stored for personal use, but users have to work to see
results.  CFEngine 3 Nova improves on this in three ways.

@itemize

@item Data collected from the monitoring system are integrated into
the aggregate knowledge console.

@item It adds a three year life-cycle trend summary, based on
`shift'-averages.

@item It adds customizable promises to monitor or
log specific highly specific user data through the generic promise
interface.

@end itemize

The end result is to display time series traces of system performance, like the
above mentioned values, and customized logs feeding custom-defined
reports.

@section Integration of monitoring with knowledge base

CFEngine 3 Nova integrates monitoring reports with the automated base
knowledge to provide self-analysis and simple summary reporting;
the Mission Portal shows important status summaries and allow users to drill down to specific reporting data.

@center @image{img-status,15cm,,Integrated Monitoring,png}

Detailed time-series views can be collected and collated, providing
honest and accurate data that allow you to gauge your own confidence
level in system performance.  Unlike most monitoring solutions,
CFEngine shows you its own confidence in the measurements taken. It
takes a finite amount of time to measure and transport data from
systems to the knowledge console. That time also provides information
about system performance. CFEngine always promises to tell you how old
data are and how confident it is in the values.

@image{img-vitalsviewer,15cm,,Integrated Monitoring,png}


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Long term trends, Custom promises to measure, Integration of monitoring with knowledge base, Monitoring extensions
@section Long term trends

CFEngine normally operates with time-series data represented
in two forms:

@itemize
@item A weekly average, plotted on a periodogram, showing performance now in relation
to the same time of week in previous weeks. After about a month data are forgotten
to ensure a sufficient rate of adaptation to new patterns.
@item The past four hours in high resolution.
@end itemize

CFEngine 3 Nova adds quarter day averages of recorded time-series which go back three
years in time. Three years is considered to be the lifetime of a computer.
Summaries of the detailed performance are summarized by flat averages for
a four-shift day:
@itemize
@item @b{Night shift}: from midnight 00:00 to 06:00
@item @b{Morning shift}: from 06:00 to 12:00
@item @b{Afternoon shift}: from 12:00 to 18:00

@section Custom promises to measure

CFEngine 3 Nova adds a new promise type in bundles for the monitoring
agent. These are written just like all other promises within a bundle
destined for the agent concerned. In this case:

@verbatim
bundle monitor watch

{
measurements:

  # promises ...

}

@end verbatim

@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Extraction strings and logging, Extracting one-off numerical data, Custom promises to measure, Custom promises to measure
@subsection Extraction strings and logging

Let's take a generic example. Suppose we have a file of nonsense  @file{/tmp/testmeasure}
and we want to extract some information that we call a `blonk'
from the file. A blonk is always on the second line of this file following
a prefix `Blonk blonk '. We would get the value like this:

@verbatim

  "/tmp/testmeasure"

      handle => "blonk_watch",
      stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "string",
      history_type => "log",
      units => "blonks",
      match_value => find_blonks,
      action => sample_min("10");

@end verbatim

This promise body has several attributes.

@table @code
@item handle
It is essential to give measurement promises handles, as these are used to label the
log files that will store the values.

@item stream_type
Tells us that we are reading from what the system considered to be a regular file
on the file-system.

@item data_type
This says that data are to be treated as text with no other meaning.

@item history_type
This tells us that we want to log the values with a time stamp.

@item units
This string is used in documentation to explain the measurement units of this result.

@item match_value
This is a body reference that represents the algorithm by which we extract data from the file.

@item action
This is the generic action parameter that may be added to all promises. We use it
here to limit the sample rate of this promise; @code{cf-monitord} samples by default
at a rate of once per 2.5 minutes.
@end table

The matching body uses a method for selecting the correct line, and a way
for extracting a pattern from the line. In every case the value extracted
is described  by using a regular expression @i{back-reference}, i.e.
a parenthesized expression  within a regular expression. The expression should
match the entire line and should contain exactly one parenthesis.

@verbatim
body match_value find_blonks
{
select_line_number => "2";
extraction_regex => "Blonk blonk ([blonk]+).*";
}
@end verbatim

The sampling rate is controlled by using the generic @code{action} constraint.
@verbatim
body action sample_min(x)
{
ifelapsed => "$(x)";
expireafter => "$(x)";
}
@end verbatim


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Extracting one-off numerical data, Extraction to list variable, Extraction strings and logging, Custom promises to measure
@subsection Extracting one-off numerical data

In this example we extract an integer value from an existing file.
Notice that CFEngine samples the process table during @code{processes}
promises so you might be able to save a new execution of a
shell command and use the cached data, depending on your need
for immediacy. It is always good practice to limit the system
load incurred by monitoring.

@verbatim
  # Test 2 - follow a special process over time
  # using CFEngine's process cache to avoid re-sampling

   "/var/cfengine/state/cf_rootprocs"

      handle => "monitor_self_watch",
      stream_type => "file",
      data_type => "int",
      history_type => "static",
      units => "kB",
      match_value => proc_value(".*cf-monitord.*",

         "root\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+[0-9.]+\s+([0-9]+).*");

@end verbatim

This match body selects a line matching a particular regular expression
and extracts the 6th column of the process table. The regular expression
skips first the root string and then five numerical values.
The value is extracted into a one-off value

@verbatim
body match_value proc_value(x,y)
{
select_line_matching => "$(x)";
extraction_regex => "$(y)";
}
@end verbatim


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Extraction to list variable,  , Extracting one-off numerical data, Custom promises to measure

In this example we discover a list of disks attached to the system.
@verbatim
  # Test 3, discover disk device information

  "/bin/df"

      stream_type => "pipe",
      data_type => "slist",
      history_type => "static",
      units => "device",
      match_value => file_system,
      action => sample_min("480"); # this is not changing much!

Unlike most other monitoring tools that use heavy-weight scripting
languages to extract data, often running many processes for each
measurement, CFEngine is a lightweight probe, using file interfaces
and regular expressions. Thus its impact on the
system is minimal. The possibilities for using this are therefore
extremely broad:

@itemize
@item Extracting accounting data from systems for charge-back.
This could be useful in cloud scenarios.
@item Discovering memory leaks.
@item Looking for zombie processes relating to specific software.
@item Logging up-time.
@item System class-dependent discovery and extraction of any kind of text
for insertion into a CMDB.

@section ACL Introduction

Access Control Lists (ACL) allow for a more fine-grained access control on
file system objects than standard Unix permissions. In spite of the success
of the POSIX model's simplicity the functionality is limited.

File permission security is a subtle topic. Users should take care
when experimenting with ACLs as the results can often be
counter-intuitive. In some cases the functioning of a system can be
compromised by changes of access rights.

Not all file systems support ACLs. In Unix systems there is a plethora
of different file system types, which have different models of ACLs.
Be aware that the mount-options for a file-system may affect the ACL
semantics.

@cartouche
@i{Note that when adding a user to a group, this will not have any
effect until the next time the user logs in on many operating
systems.}
@end cartouche

As CFEngine works across multiple platforms and needs to support ACLs
with different APIs, a common ACL syntax has been abstracted to add a
layer of portability. This is a specific feature of CFEngine, not of
the host systems. A generic syntax ensures that the ACLs that are
commonly needed can be coded in a portable fashion. CFEngine 3 Nova's
ACL model is translated into native permissions for implementation;
CFEngine does not interfere with native access mechanisms in any way.
The CFEngine ACL syntax is similar to the POSIX ACL syntax, which is
supported by BSD, Linux, HP-UX and Solaris.

CFEngine also allows you to specify platform-dependent ACLs. Of
course, these ACLs will only work on the given platform, and must
therefore be shielded with classes that select the appropriate model
within the promise body.

Currently, CFEngine 3 Nova supports the following ACL APIs and operating
systems.

@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Concepts, Entity types, File ACL example, File ACL example
@subsection Concepts

As mentioned, there are many different ACL APIs. For example, the
POSIX draft standard, NTFS and NFSv4 have different and incompatible
ACL APIs. As CFEngine is cross-platform, these differences should, for
the most usual cases, be transparent to the user. However, some
distinctions are impossible to make transparent, and thus the user
needs to know about them.

We will explore the different concepts of ACL implementations that are
critical to understanding how permissions are defined and enforced in
the different file systems. As a running example, we will consider
NTFS ACLs and POSIX ACLs, because the distinction between these ACL
APIs is strong.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Entity types, Owners, Concepts, File ACL example
@subsection Entity types

All ACL APIs support three basic entity types: user, group and
all. User and group are simply users and groups of the system, where a
group may contain multiple users. all is all users of the system, this
type is called "other" in POSIX and "Everyone" in NTFS.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Owners, Changing owner, Entity types, File ACL example
@subsection Owners

All file system objects have an owner, which by default is the entity
that created the object. The owner can always be a user. However, in
some file systems, groups can also be owners (e.g. the
"Administrators" group in NTFS). In some ACL APIs (e.g POSIX),
permissions can be set explicitly for the owner, i.e. the owner has an
independent ACL entry.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Changing owner, Permissions, Owners, File ACL example
@subsection Changing owner

It is generally not possible for user A to set user B as the
owner of a file system object, even if A owns the object. The
superuser ("root" in POSIX, "Administrator" in NTFS) can however
always set itself as the owner of an object. In POSIX, the superuser
may in fact set any user as the owner, but it NTFS it can only take
ownership.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Permissions, Deny permissions, Changing owner, File ACL example
@subsection Permissions

An entity can be given a set of permissions on a file system object
(e.g. read and write). The data structure holding the permissions for
one entity is called an "Access Control Entry" (ACE). As many users
and groups may have sets of permissions on a given object, multiple
Access Control Entries are combined to an Access Control List, which
is associated with the object.

The set of available permissions differ with ACL APIs. For example,
the "Take Ownership" permission in NTFS has no equivalent in
POSIX. However, for the most common situations, it is possible to get
equivalent security properties by mapping a set of permissions in one
API to another set in a second API.

There are however different rules for the access to the contents of a
directory with no access. In POSIX, no sub-objects of a directory with
no access can be accessed. However, in NTFS, sub-objects that the entity
has access rights to can be accessed, regardless of whether the entity
has access rights to the containing directory.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Deny permissions, Changing permissions, Permissions, File ACL example
@subsection Deny permissions

If no permissions are given to a particular entity, the entity will be
denied any access to the object. But in some file systems, like NTFS,
it is also possible to explicitly deny specific permissions to
entities. Thus, two types of permissions exist in these systems: allow
and deny.

It is generally good practice to design the ACLs to specify who is
allowed to do some operations, in contrary to who is not allowed to do
some operations, if possible. The reason for this is that describing
who is not allowed to do things tend to lead to more complex
rules and could therefore more easily lead to mis-configurations and
security holes. A good rule is to only define that users should not be
able to access a resource in the following two scenarios:

@itemize
@item Denying access to a subset of a group which is allowed access
@item Denying a specific permission when a user or a group has full access
@end itemize

If you think about it, this is the same principle that applies to
firewall configuration: it is easier to white-list, specify who should
have access, than to blacklist, specify who should not have access. In
addition, since CFEngine is designed to be cross-platform and some ACL
permissions are not available on all platforms, we should strive to
keep the ACLs as simple as possible. This helps us avoid surprises
when the ACLs are enforced by different platforms.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Changing permissions, Effective permissions, Deny permissions, File ACL example
@subsection Changing permissions

Generally, only the owner may change permissions on a file system
object. However, superusers can also indirectly change permissions by
taking ownership first. In POSIX, superusers can change permissions
without taking ownership. In NTFS, either ownership or a special
permission ("Change Permissions") is needed to alter permissions.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Effective permissions, Inheritance, Changing permissions, File ACL example
@subsection Effective permissions

Unfortunately, even though two ACL APIs support all the permissions
listed in an ACL, the ACL may be interpreted differently. For a given
entity and object with ACL, there are two conceptually different ways
to interpret which permissions the entity obtains: ACE precedence and
cumulative ACL.

@c TODO: create figure of example?
For example, let @samp{alice} be a user of the group
@samp{staff}. There is an ACL on the file @file{schedule}, giving
@samp{alice} write permission, and the group @samp{staff} read
permission. We will consider two ways to determine the effective
permissions of @samp{alice} to @file{schedule}.

Firstly, by taking the most precise match in the ACL, @samp{alice} will be
granted write permission only. This is because an ACE describing @samp{alice}
is more precise than an ACE describing a group @samp{alice} is member
of. However, note that some ACEs may have the same precedence, like
two ACEs describing permissions for groups @samp{alice} is member of. Then,
cumulative matching will be done on these ACEs (explained next). This
is how POSIX does it.

Secondly, we can take the cumulative permissions, which yields a user
permissions from all the ACE entries with his user name, groups he is
member of or the ACE entry specifying all users. In this case,
@samp{alice} would get read and write on @file{schedule}. NTFS
computes the effective permissions in this way.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Inheritance,  , Effective permissions, File ACL example
@subsection Inheritance

 @c TODO: Correct to inherit to someone ?

Directories have ACLs associated with them, but they also have the
ability to inherit an ACL to sub-objects created within them. POSIX
calls the former ACL type "access ACL" and the latter "default ACL",
and we will use the same terminology.

@c TODO: Create tool to output effective permissions if ACL is applied ?


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  CFEngine 3 Generic ACL Syntax, POSIX ACL type, File ACL example, File Access Control Lists
@section CFEngine 3 Generic ACL Syntax

@c FIXME: TODO: Say which OS's we are supporting, and which ACL types
@c we are supporting on them.

The CFEngine 3 ACL syntax is divided into two main parts, a generic
and an API specific (native). The generic syntax can be used on any
file system for which CFEngine supports ACLs, while the native syntax
gives access to all the permissions available under a particular ACL
API.

An ACL can contain both generic and native syntax. However, if it
contains native syntax, it can only be enforced on systems supporting
the given ACL API. Thus, only the generic syntax is portable.

Note that even though the same generic ACL is set on two systems with
different ACL APIs, it may be enforced differently because the ACE
matching algorithms differ. For instance, as discussed earlier, NTFS
uses cumulative matching, while POSIX uses precedence
matching. CFEngine cannot alter the matching algorithms, and
simulating one or the other by changing ACL definitions is not
possible in all cases, and would probably lead to confusion. Thus, if
an ACL is to be used on two systems with different ACL APIs, the user
is encouraged to check that any differences in matching algorithms do
not lead to mis-configurations.

The CFEngine generic ACL syntax explained next, and native syntax is
described in following sections.

  identifier containing alphanumeric characters and underscores. We
will use this name when referring to the ACL.

@item @code{acl_type} (optional) specifies the ACL API used to
describe the ACL. It defaults to @code{generic}, which allows only
CFEngine generic ACL syntax, but is valid on all supported
systems. @code{acl_type} only needs to be specified if native
permissions are being used in the ACL (see @code{nperms} below). If
@code{acl_type} is set to anything other than @code{generic}, the
system on which it is enforced must support this ACL API.

@item @code{acl_method} (optional) can be set to either
  @code{append} or @code{overwrite}, and defaults to
  @code{append}. Setting it to @code{append} only adds or modifies the
  ACEs that are specified in @code{aces} (and
  @code{specify_inherit_aces}, see below). If set to
  @code{overwrite}, the specified ACL will completely replace the
  currently set ACL. All required fields must then be set in the
  specified ACL (e.g. @code{all} in POSIX), see the following sections
  describing the supported native APIs.

@c TODO: Support acl_method:append for specify_inherit_aces independently?

@item @code{acl_directory_inherit} (optional) specifies the ACL of
  newly created sub-objects. Only valid if the ACL is set on a
directory. On directories, @code{nochange} is the default and
indicates that the ACL that is currently given to newly created child
objects is left unchanged. If set to @code{clear}, no ACL will be
inherited, but the file system specifies a default ACL, which varies
with the file system (see the following sections on the supported ACL
APIs). @code{parent} indicates that the ACL set in @code{aces} (see
below) should be inherited to sub-objects.  If set to @code{specify},
@code{specify_inherit_aces} specifies the inherited ACL, and
@code{acl_method} applies for @code{specify_inherit_aces} too.

@item @code{aces} is a list of access control entries. It is parsed
  from left to right, and multiple entries with the same entity-type
  and id is allowed. This is necessary to specify permissions with
  different @code{perm_type} for the same entity (e.g. to allow read
  permission but explicitly deny write).

@item @code{specify_inherit_aces} (optional) is a list of access control
  entries that are set on child objects. It is also parsed from left
  to right and allows multiple entries with same entity-type and
  id. Only valid if @code{acl_directory_inherit} is set to
  @code{specify}.

@item @code{user} indicates that the line applies to a user specified
  by the user identifier @code{uid}. @code{mode} is the permission
  mode string.

@item @code{group} indicates that the line applies to a group specified
  by the group identifier @code{gid}. @code{mode} is the permission
  mode string.

@item @code{all} indicates that the line applies to every
  user. @code{mode} is the permission mode string.

@item @code{uid} is a valid user name for the system and
  cannot be empty. However, if @code{acl_type} is @code{posix},
@code{uid} can be set to * to indicate the user that owns the file
system object.

@item @code{gid} is a valid group name for the system and
  cannot be empty. However, if @code{acl_type} is @code{posix},
@code{gid} can be set to * to indicate the file group.

@item @code{mode} is one or more strings
  @code{op}|@code{gperms}|(@code{nperms}); a concatenation of @code{op},
  @code{gperms} and optionally (@code{nperms}), see below, separated
  with commas (e.g. +rx,-w(s)). @code{mode} is parsed from left to
  right.
@c TODO: include support for @code{fullaccess}, @code{noaccess},
@c and @code{remove}

@item @code{op} specifies the operation on any existing permissions,
  if the specified ACE already exists. @code{op} can be =, empty, + or
  -. = or empty sets the permissions to the ACE as stated, + adds and
  - removes the permissions from any existing ACE.

@item @code{nperms} (optional) specifies ACL API specific
  (native) permissions. Only valid if @code{acl_type} is not
  @code{generic}. Valid values for @code{nperms} varies with different
  ACL types, and are specified in subsequent sections.

@item @code{perm_type} (optional) can be set to either @code{allow} or
  @code{deny}, and defaults to @code{allow}. @code{deny} is only valid
  if @code{acl_type} is set to an ACL type that support deny
  permissions.

@item @code{gperms} (generic permissions) is a concatenation of zero
  or more of the characters shown in the table below. If left empty,
  none of the permissions are set.

@subsection POSIX-specific ACL syntax

@b{Native permissions}
The valid values for @code{nperms} in POSIX are @code{r},@code{w}, and
@code{x}. These are in fact the same as the generic permissions, so
specifying them as generic or native gives the same effect.

@b{File owner and group}
A user-ACE with uid set to * indicates file object owner. A group-ACE
with gid set to * indicates file group.

@b{mask} mask can be specified as a normal ACE, as
@code{mask:mode}. mask specifies the maximum permissions that are
granted to named users (not owning user), file group and named
groups. mask is optional, if it is left unspecified it will will be
computed as the union of the permissions granted to named users, file
group and named groups (see acl_calc_mask(3)).

@b{Required ACEs} POSIX requires existence of an ACE for the file
owner, (@code{user:*:mode}), the file group (@code{group:*:mode}),
other (@code{all:mode}) and mask (@code{mask:mode}). As mentioned,
CFEngine automatically creates a mask-ACE, if missing. However, if
@code{method} is set to @code{overwrite}, the user must ensure that
the rest of the required entries are specified.


@c ------------------------------------------------------
@node  Generic syntax mapping, POSIX ACL examples, POSIX-specific ACL syntax, POSIX ACL type
@subsection Generic syntax mapping

@b{Entity types}
All entity types in the generic syntax are mapped to the corresponding
entity types with the same name in POSIX, except @code{all} which
corresponds to @code{other} in POSIX.

@b{Generic permissions}

As shown in the table below, @code{gperms} is mapped straightforward
from generic to POSIX permission flags.

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .3
@headitem Generic flag  @tab POSIX flag
@item @code{r} @tab @code{r}
@item @code{w} @tab @code{w}
@item @code{x} @tab @code{x}
@end multitable


@b{Inheritance} POSIX supports @code{acl_directory_inherit} set to
@code{specify}. The @code{specify_inherit_aces} list is then set as the
default ACL in POSIX (see acl(5)).

If @code{acl_directory_inherit} is set to @code{parent}, CFEngine
copies the access ACL to the default ACL. Thus, newly created objects
get the same access ACL as the containing directory.

@code{acl_directory_inherit} set to @code{clear} corresponds to no
POSIX default ACL. This results in that newly created objects get ACEs
for owning user, group and other. The permissions are set in
accordance with the mode parameter to the creating function and the
umask (usually results in 644 for files and 755 for directories).

@b{Further reading} The manual page @code{acl(5)} contains much
information on POSIX ACLs, including the access check algorithm. In
particular, this shows that POSIX uses ACE precedence matching, and
exactly how it is done. Operating systems usually bundle tools for
manipulating ACLs, for example @code{getfacl(1)} and
@code{setfacl(1)}.

@subsection NT-specific ACL syntax

@b{Native permissions}
NTFS supports fourteen so-called special file permissions. However, we
do not consider the @code{Synchronize} permission because it is used
for a different purpose than the other permissions. In order to give
access to the thirteen relevant permissions, CFEngine defines a native
permission flag for each of them. This one-to-one mapping is as
follows.

@multitable @columnfractions .40 .20
@headitem NTFS Special Permission @tab CFEngine nperm
@item Execute File / Traverse Folder @tab x
@item Read Data / List Folder @tab r
@item Read Attributes @tab t
@item Read Extended Attributes @tab T
@item Write Data / Create Files @tab w
@item Append Data / Create Folders @tab a
@item Write Attributes @tab b
@item Write Extended Attributes @tab B
@item Delete Sub-folders and Files @tab D
@item Delete @tab d
@item Read Permissions @tab p
@item Change Permissions @tab c
@item Take Ownership @tab o
@end multitable

The semantics of these special permissions can be found in the
references for further reading below.


@b{Denying permissions}
NTFS supports setting @code{perm_type} to @code{deny} in addition to
@code{allow}, which is the default. This can for instance be used to
denying a user a particular permission that a group membership grants
him. It is important to note that the precedence of allow and deny
permissions is as follows:

@enumerate
@item Explicit Deny
@item Explicit Allow
@item Inherited Deny from parent
@item Inherited Allow from parent
@item Inherited Deny from grandparent
@item Inherited Allow from grandparent
@item ...
@end enumerate

Thus, the closer the permission is to the object in the directory
path, the greater precedence it is given.

An important point here is that even though a user is denied access in
a parent directory and this permission is inherited, but one of the
groups he is member of is explicitly allowed access to a file in that
directory, he is actually allowed to access the file.


@b{Ownership}
In NTFS, the default owner is the user who is currently logged on. The
only exceptions occur when the user is a member of either the
@samp{Administrators} group or the @samp{Domain Admins} group.

Owners of NTFS objects can allow another user to take ownership by
giving that user Take Ownership permission. Owners can also give other
users the Change Permissions flag. In addition, members of the
@samp{Administrator} group can always take ownership. It is never
possible to give ownership of an object to a user, but members of
the @samp{Administrator} group can give ownership to that group.


@subsection Generic syntax mapping

@b{Entity types}
The three entity types of NTFS are called user, group and
Everyone. The user and group entity types in NTFS are mapped to the
user and group entity types in CFEngine. Everyone is mapped to all in
CFEngine.

@b{Generic permissions}
For NTFS, CFEngine maps the @code{gperms} to @code{nperms} as
follows.

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .3
@headitem Generic flag  @tab Native flags
@item @code{r} @tab @code{rtTp}
@item @code{w} @tab @code{wabB}
@item @code{x} @tab @code{x}
@end multitable

The rationale for this mapping is discussed next.

NTFS groups the thirteen special permissions to create five sets of
permissions:
@itemize
@item Read
@item Read & Execute
@item Write
@item Modify
@item Full Control
@end itemize
In addition, we have the List Folder Contents set, which is equivalent
to the Read & Execute set but is only available to- and inherited by
directories. The Full Control set is unsurprisingly all the thirteen
special permissions. An overview of the NTFS mapping of special
permissions to sets is given in the references stated as further
reading below. The NTFS permission sets can be expressed in CFEngine
syntax as follows.

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .4
@headitem NTFS sets  @tab CFEngine gperms|(nperms)
@item @code{Read} @tab @code{r}
@item @code{Write} @tab @code{w}
@item @code{Read & Execute} @tab @code{rx}
@item @code{Modify} @tab @code{rwx(d)}
@item @code{Full Control} @tab @code{rwx(dDco)}
@end multitable


@b{Inheritance}
@code{acl_directory_inherit} set to @code{clear} disables
inheritance, such that child objects get a default ACL specified by
the operating system, namely Full control for the file object creator and
@code{SYSTEM} accounts.


@b{POSIX compatibility}
Be aware that setting @code{gperms} to @samp{rwx} on directories is
more restrictive in NTFS than in POSIX ACLs. This is because NTFS does
not allow deletion of objects within a directory without a Delete
Sub-folders and Files permission on the directory (or a Delete
permission on the object itself), while in POSIX, @samp{rwx} on the
directory is sufficient to delete any file or directory within it
(except when the sticky-flag is set on the directory). Thus, on
directories, the NTFS-equivalent to POSIX @code{gperms} set to
@samp{rwx} is @samp{rwx(D)}. However, for files, @samp{rwx} is
equivalent in POSIX and NTFS semantics.

In POSIX ACLs, there is no explicit delete permission, but the
execute, write and sticky permissions on the containing directory
determines if a user has privileges to delete. In POSIX, the owner and
root can change permissions, while usually only the root may change
the ownership, so there is no direct equivalent to the Change
Permission and Take Ownership in POSIX.


@b{Further reading}
A description of the fourteen NTFS permission and the mapping of these
into sets is given at @url{http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308419}.

CFEngine 3 Nova adds a simple server extension to the Community Edition
server, namely the ability to encode data directly in policy.
This feature is useful for distributing password hashes
to systems.

@node  Server access resource type, Function remotescalar, Server extensions, Server extensions
@section Server access resource type

By default, access to resources granted by the server are
files. However, sometimes it is useful to cache @code{literal}
strings, hints and data in the server, e.g. the contents of variables,
hashed passwords etc for easy access. In the case of literal data, the
promise handle serves as the reference identifier for queries. Queries
are instigated by function calls by any agent.

@verbatim
access:

  "This is a string with a $(localvar) for remote collection"

        handle  => "test_scalar",
  resource_type => "literal",
        admit   => { "127.0.0.1" };

@end verbatim

The promise looks exactly like a promise for a file object, but the data
are literal and entered into the policy. This is a useful approach for
distributing password hashes on a need-to-know basis from a central location.
The server configuration file need not be distributed to any client, thus
only authorized systems will have access to the hashes.

The client side of the literal look up function is:

Nova supports notion of `environments' -- named groups of hosts, like
`development', 'QA' and 'production' hosts.

Each environment gets
@itemize
@item Separate subdirectory `environment_<NAME>' for storing promises
@item Separate subdirectory `environment_<NAME>/cdp_inputs' for content-based policies
@item grouping of hosts belonging to environment in GUI
@end itemize

Default Nova policies group hosts into environments in bundle `common
environments'. This bundle defines
@itemize
@item `environments.active' variable. This variable holds the name of environment for current host, and is used by other promises in Nova templates. This variable does not affect grouping in GUI.
@item global `environment_<NAME>' class. This class should be defined if given host belongs to the `<NAME>' environment. GUI groups hosts using this class.
@end itemize
Administrator may customize this bundle as needed, adding or removing
environments defined (Nova does not have any built-in environment
names), changing rules for hosts selection and making any other
modifications, the only requirement for environments feature to work
is keeping aforementioned variables and classes defined. Note that the
environment name 'any' is reserved.

Default rules expect file `environment_$(promises.active)/promises.cf'
to exist and to contain bundle `agent main', this bundle is included
last from main promises.cf and should implement/include/use any
environment-specific rules.

@node  Implementing workflows in Nova,  , Environments in Nova, Environments and workflows
@section Implementing workflows in Nova

Workflows are implemented easily with Nova, administrator starts with
defining necessary set of environments (usually those are
`development', `testing' and 'production'), then develops new
configuration in one enviroment, and promotes rules first to testing
and then to production environment.

Promotion of rules is performed by copying rules from one
environment's subdirectory to next one.

@section What are virtualization and cloud computing?
@sp 1

Virtualization refers to the ability to run multiple host instances on
a single physical node. Cloud computing typically refers to what is
called `platform as a service', or deployment of virtual machines on
demand, often as an on-line service.

In this document, virtualization support refers specifically to
hypervisor technologies supported by the open source library layer @i{libvirt}
project, which includes interfaces for Xen, KVM, Vmware-ESX, and more.
CFEngine thus integrates freely with other tools based on this library, such
as @i{virsh} and the @i{Virtual Manager} graphical user interface.


@node  Why build virtualization support into CFEngine?, What can CFEngine do with virtual machines?, What are virtualization and cloud computing?, Virtualization
@section Why build virtualization support into CFEngine?
@sp 1

Virtualization engines (usually called supervisors or hypervisors) are
seeing an explosion of development. They exist as a number of projects
in various stages of maturity. The libvirt project was designed as
an integration layer based on an XML specification.

The tools for management are still quite primitive and require much
manual work. CFEngine has a unique role to play in maintaining desired
state in virtual machine systems.  

In the cloud, virtual machines may be rented from remote commercial
providers, and managed as disposable resources. Convergent or
`self-healing' maintenance is an essential method for managing
machines that are geographically remote and awkward to access, e.g.
machines in other time-zones that it is impractical to monitor by
legacy methods.


@node  What can CFEngine do with virtual machines?, Guest environments promises, Why build virtualization support into CFEngine?, Virtualization
@section What can CFEngine do with virtual machines?
@sp 1

The simple answer is: most things that @i{libvirt} can do, with added
convergence to a desired state: that means, creating, destroying and
starting and stopping machines. By starting virtual machines through
CFEngine, you can be sure that a given `virtual guest' is running on
one and only one physical host, thus avoiding conflicts that are
difficult to detect with centralized systems.

CFEngine does not support everything that libvirt does -- it offers a
simplified interface that is meant for robustness, stability and
hands-free repeatability.

@sp 1
@cartouche
CFEngine does not use libvirt's TLS based web communication layer.  It
manages every host as an independent entity, in typical CFEngine
fashion, using CFEngine's own distributed cooperation to provide the
implicit communication.  CFEngine does not currently support so-called
`live migration' of virtual machines.
@end cartouche
@sp 1

@node  Guest environments promises, Virtualization types supported, What can CFEngine do with virtual machines?, Virtualization

A virtual machine is one example of what CFEngine calls an `guest
environment'.  You can promise to create (and host) an guest
environment with certain attributes, just as you can promise to host a

@item The promiser (in this case @samp{myUbuntu}) is the name of the virtual
machine. This should be a unique identifier, as we need to be able to
refer to machines uniquely.

@item The guest environment host is the name of the computer that
is the host for the virtual machine. 

@item Normally when we want to ensure something on a machine, we use classes
to decide where the promise will be made. For guest environments, however,
we need to make promises about the uniqueness of the machine. When you
make a machine instance you normally want it to be running on one and
only one host. So you want @i{every} machine to make a promise. On the
guest environment's host, you want to promise that the guest environment is
running, and on every other machine you want to promise that it is
not. In CFEngine, you simply include a unique class belonging to host
in the promise using @code{environment_host} and CFEngine assumes that
rest. Unique classes might include
@itemize
@item Hostname class e.g. @code{myhost_CFEngine_com}
@item IP address class e.g. @code{ipv4_123_456_789_123}
@end itemize
@end itemize

An alternative way to write this example is to quote the XML
specification in CFEngine directly. This has a few advantages: you can
re-use the data and use it as a template, filling in
CFEngine-variables. You can thus adapt the configuration using
CFEngine's classes.

@page
@verbatim
bundle agent my_vm_cloud

guest_environments:

   "myUbuntu" # the running instance name, defined in XML
       environment_resources => virt_xml("$(this.promiser)"),
       environment_type      => "xen",
       environment_host      => "myphysicalcomputer";
       environment_state     => "create"
}

@node  Virtualization types supported, Distinct states, Guest environments promises, Virtualization
@section Virtualization types supported
@sp 1

CFEngine currently supports virtualization only through libvirt, so it supports
those technologies that libvirt supports. Currently this includes  most popular
technologies. You must choose the type of monitor that is to be responsible for
keeping the guest environment promise. In CFEngine, you should choose between a
machine environment or network environment of the following types:
@table @code
@item xen
A Xen hypervisor virtual domain.
@item kvm
A KVM hypervisor virtual domain.
@item esx
A VMware hypervisor virtual domain.
@item test
The libvirt test-hypervisor virtual domain.
@item xen_net
A Xen hypervisor virtual network.
@item kvm_net
A KVM hypervisor virtual network
@item esx_net
An ESX/VMWare hypervisor virtual network.
@item test_net
The test hypervisor virtual network.
@item zone
A Solaris zone (future development)
@item ec2
An Amazon EC2 instance (future development)
@item eucalyptus
A Eucalyptus instance (future development)
@end table


Once again, you must consult the libvirt documentation for details.

@node  Distinct states, Example deployment, Virtualization types supported, Virtualization
@section Distinct states
@sp 1

Libvirt recognizes a number of distinct states are transliterated into CFEngine
as
@table @code
@item create
Build and start an guest environment.
@item delete
Halt and remove runtime resources associated with an guest environment.
@item running
An existing guest environment is in a running state.
@item suspended
An existing guest environment is in a `paused' state.
@item down
An existing guest environment is in a halted state.
@end table
The default promised state is for a machine to be running 
wherever the  @code{environment_host} class is true, and
suspended or down elsewhere.



@node  Example deployment,  , Distinct states, Virtualization
@section Example deployment
@sp 1

Prerequisites: you need to make a `disk image' for the machine, or a
virtual disk of blocks that can be allocated. This image does not have to
contain any data, it will simply as a block device for the VM. You
can then install it by booting the machine from a network image, like a
PXE/kickstart installation.

If you want to allocate disk blocks as the file grows, you can create
a file with a hole. The following command will creates a file of
2048MB, but the actual data blocks are allocated in a lazy fashion:

@verbatim

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/srv/xen/my.img oflag=direct bs=1M seek=2047 count=1

@end verbatim
To reserve all the data blocks right away: 
@verbatim

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/srv/xen/my.img oflag=direct bs=1M count=2048

@end verbatim

Libvirt uses an XML file format that cannot be circumvented. CFEngine
promises to honor the promises that are expressed in this file, as in
the examples above.  You need to find out about this file format from
the libvirt website.  To get CFEngine to Honor these promises, you
point it to the specification that it should promise using
@code{spec_file}.

You need to set up a network for virtual machines to communicate with
the outside world. This can also be done with CFEngine, using the
network promise types to build a bridge into a virtual network.

Then just run CFEngine to start, stop or manage the guest environments on
each localhost. Run in verbose mode to see how CFEngine maintains the states
convergently.

@node  Content-Driven Policies, Windows-specific features in Nova, Virtualization, Top
@chapter Content-Driven Policies

In Nova 2.0, Content-Driven Policies (CDP) were introduced to make
policy management easier. In contrast to policies written in the
CFEngine language, these are semi-colon separated fields in a text
file that the user just fills with content. All the underlying
enforcement and reporting are taken care of automatically by Nova.

For example, to manage three Windows services, the following
services-CDP will suffice.

@verbatim
# masterfiles/cdp_inputs/service_list.txt

Dnscache;stop;fix;windows
ALG;start;warn;windows
RemoteRegistry;start;fix;Windows_Server_2008

@end verbatim

The meanings of the fields are different depending of the CDP-type,
but explained in the file header. With these three lines, we ensure
the correct status of three services on all our Windows machines and
are given specialized reports on the outcome. 

@c The Content-Driven Policy services report is shown below.

@c @image{cdp_services_report,15cm,,The Content-Driven Policy services report,png}


@section Benefits of Content-Driven Policies

As seen in the example above, Content-Driven Policies are easy to
write and maintain, especially for users unfamiliar with the CFEngine
language. They are designed to capture the essence of a specific,
popular use of CFEngine, and make it easier. For example, the services
Content-Driven Policy above has the following equivalent in the
CFEngine language.

@smallexample

bundle agent service_example
@{
services:

  "Dnscache"
    comment            => "Check services status of Dnscache",
    handle             => "srv_Dnscache_windows",
    service_policy     => "stop",
    service_method     => force_deps,
    action             => policy("fix"),
    ifvarclass         => "windows";

  "ALG"
    comment            => "Check services status of ALG",
    handle             => "srv_ALG_windows",
    service_policy     => "start",
    service_method     => force_deps,
    action             => policy("warn"),
    ifvarclass         => "windows";

  "RemoteRegistry"
    comment            => "Check services status of ALG",
    handle             => "srv_ALG_windows",
    service_policy     => "start",
    service_method     => force_deps,
    action             => policy("fix"),
    ifvarclass         => "Windows_Server_2008";

@}

@end smallexample

Writing this policy is clearly more time-consuming and error-prone. On
the other hand, it allows for much more flexibility than Content-Driven
Policies, when that is needed.

CFEngine provides Content-Driven Policies to cover mainstream
management tasks like the following.

@itemize
@item File change/difference management
@item Service management
@item Database management
@item Application / script management
@end itemize


@section Getting started
All the CDP input files are located in
@code{/var/cfengine/masterfiles/cdp_inputs} on your policy hub. Nova
is bundled with some examples, but ensure to @emph{edit the examples
before enabling them}.

To enable all the CDPs located in @code{cdp_inputs/}, open
@code{promises.cf} in your masterfiles directory. Remove the comment
(@code{#}) in front of the cdp entries in @code{bundlesequence} and
@code{inputs}, to make it look like the following.

@verbatim
bundlesequence => {
                  "def",
                  "cfengine_management",
                  "service_catalogue",
                  "cdp",
...

        inputs => {
...
                  "cdp_lib/cdp.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_acls.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_registry.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_file_changes.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_file_diffs.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_services.cf",
                  "cdp_lib/cdp_commands.cf",
...
@end verbatim

When the hosts start reporting back on the outcome of these policies
(usually within 10 minutes), you can view the reports in the CDP reports viewer or from your
Knowledge Map on the policy hub. 

@c Go to the @code{Status} tab, find the
@c Content-Driven Policies drop-down, select the CDP type
@c (e.g. @code{Services}) and click @code{Generate}.

@chapter Windows-specific features in Nova

In this section, we will explore the Windows-specific features of the
native Windows version of CFEngine 3 Nova, and how it integrates with
Windows. We will also consider features that are more interesting or
popular on Windows than on other platforms.

Feature highlights include Windows service management and integration,
event logging, Windows registry repair, and fine-tuned file security
support through access control lists. See the sections on databases
and ACLs to find information on Windows registry repair and NTFS ACLs,
respectively. We will look at some of the other added features next.

@section Windows service management

CFEngine 3 Nova can maintain complete control of the state of all
Windows services, in addition to Unix daemons. Services prone to
security issues or errors can easily be given a disabled state.

@image{winservice-disabled_policy,8cm,,Disabled Windows service,png}

A service can also be given a running state, in which case CFEngine
Nova ensures that it is running, and starts it if it is not, with
parameters if desired. More advanced policy options are also
available, including support for starting and stopping dependencies,
and configuring when the services should be started (e.g. only when
they are being used).

Furthermore, the CFEngine executor in Nova now runs as a Windows
service itself. This means it runs in the background an starts with
Windows, before any user logs in. It can be configured, started and
stopped from the ``Services'' listing in Windows.

Note that the name of a service in Windows may be different from its
``Display name''. CFEngine 3 Nova policies use the name, not the display
name, due to the need of uniqueness.

@image{winservice-properties_name,7cm,,Windows service name and Display name,png}


@section Windows event logging
Event logs are the Windows counterpart to syslog from Unix. The main
difference is that event logs aim to group similar log messages,
giving each group an event id.

@image{winevent-repaired-acl-closeup,7cm,,Promise repaired in Event Viewer,png}

A program that creates logs, such as CFEngine 3 Nova, must define the
possible event IDs, and their meaning. In many applications, only one
event id is defined, a generic log message. However, CFEngine 3 Nova
defines the following range of event IDs, which allows for automatic
handling of log messages.

@multitable @columnfractions .4 .2 .2
@headitem Description @tab Event ID @tab Type
@item Promise kept @tab 100 @tab Information
@item Promise repaired @tab 101 @tab Information
@item Promise not repaired due warn only policy @tab 102 @tab Error
@item Promise not repaired due to error @tab 103 @tab Error
@item Report promise @tab 104 @tab Information
@item Generic information @tab 105 @tab Information
@item Generic verbose @tab 106 @tab Information
@item Generic warning @tab 107 @tab Warning
@item Generic error @tab 108 @tab Error
@end multitable

@image{winevent-notkept-storage,10cm,,Promise not kept in Event Viewer,png}

The Nova event logs can be found under the ``System'' logs.  Almost
all monitoring products for Windows supports reading event logs, and
they can thus monitor logs from CFEngine 3 Nova as well. This makes it
possible to do more advanced querying on the status of a machine
running CFEngine 3 Nova, e.g. to show all promises that have not been
kept in a certain time interval. However, we recommend using the
Knowledge Map to do more advanced things, as it is specifically made
for this purpose and supports all operating systems that CFEngine runs
on.

@section Windows special variables
Three new special variables have been added to the Windows version of
CFEngine 3 Nova.

@itemize

@item @code{sys.windir} contains the Windows directory,
e.g. ``C:\WINDOWS''.

@item @code{sys.winsysdir} contains the Windows system directory,
e.g. ``C:\WINDOWS\system32''.

@item @code{sys.winprogdir} contains the program files directory,
e.g. ``C:\Program Files''.

@end itemize

Note that these variables are not statically coded, but retrieved from
the current system. For example, @code{sys.winprogdir} is often
different on Windows versions in distinct languages.


@section Windows hard classes
The Windows version of CFEngine 3 Nova defines hard classes to pinpoint
the exact version of Windows that it is running on, the service pack
version and if it's a server or workstation.

First of all, the class @code{windows} is defined on all Windows
platforms. For Windows workstations, such as Windows XP,
@code{WinWorkstation} is defined. On Windows servers, such as Windows
Server 2003, @code{WinServer} is defined. In addition, if the server
is a domain controller, @code{DomainController} is defined. Note that
if @code{DomainController} is defined, then @code{WinServer} is also
defined, for natural reasons.

The class @code{Service_Pack_X_Y} is defined according to the service
pack version. For example, at the time of writing,
@code{Service_Pack_3_0} is set on an updated Windows XP operating
system.

To allow taking specific actions on different Windows versions, one
of the following hard classes is defined.

@itemize
@item @code{Windows_7}
@item @code{Windows_Server_2008_R2}
@item @code{Windows_Server_2008}
@item @code{Windows_Vista}
@item @code{Windows_Server_2003_R2}
@item @code{Windows_Home_Server}
@item @code{Windows_Server_2003}
@item @code{Windows_XP_Professional_x64_Edition}
@item @code{Windows_XP}
@item @code{Windows_2000}
@end itemize

Note that all defined hard classes for a given system is shown by
running @code{cf-promises -v}.


@section Notes on windows policies
A potential problem source when writing policies for windows is that
paths to executables often contain spaces. This makes it impossible
for CFEngine to know where the executable ends and the parameters to
it starts. To solve this, we place escaped quotes around the
executable.

Additionally, Windows does not support that processes start themselves
in in the background (i.e. fork off a child process in the Unix
world). The result is that CFEngine is always waiting for the commands
to finish execution before checking the next promise. To avoid this,
use the background attribute in the action body-part.

Both these things are demonstrated in the following example.

@verbatim

body common control
{
bundlesequence  => { "main" };
}

bundle agent main
{
commands:

"\"C:\Program Files\Some Dir\program name.bat\" --silent --batch"
  action => background;
}

body action background
{
background => "true";
}

@end verbatim

Finally, one should note that Windows lacks support for certain
features that are utilized in Unix versions of CFEngine. These include
symbolic links, file groups, user and group identifiers.

Thus, the parts of promises containing these features will be
ignored. For example, the @code{getgid()} function does not return
anything on Windows. The reference manual documents exactly which
promises are ignored and not.  Also, @code{cf-agent} from CFEngine
Nova prints warning messages on ignored attributes when run in verbose
mode.

@node Configuration of external authentication,  Configure LDAP, Windows-specific features in Nova, Top
@appendix Configuration of external authentication

External authentication is available for CFEngine 3 Nova and up, but by default the Mission Portal will use the embedded database to store user information (default user name and password are "admin" and "admin"). Note that users in the default database will be locked out of the Mission Portal upon configuration of external authentication. They will regain access if external authentication is deactivated by selecting the Database button on the Mission Portal Settings page (see below).

To enable external authentication on a fresh install, log on to the Mission Portal with the default user and password and go to "Settings". Click "Mission Portal Settings" and enter the appropriate configuration for LDAP or Active Directory as described below.

@item User directory: Directory name where user names are stored, e.g. cn=users or ou=people
@item Member attribute: Field name used to match user group (only needed for OPENLDAP), e.g. memberUid
@end itemize

Always check that the entered configuration is correct by clicking the "Test it" button before submitting changes. Enter a valid user name and password in the popup to test LDAP bind. Submitting an incorrect configuration will put LDAP down and lock out all users, CFE Nova therefore comes with a fallback solution. Select a fallback administrator group in the database from the dropbox, CFE Nova will look for users in this group when an incorrect configuration has been passed. A member of this group will then be able to log on to the Mission Portal using his database user name and password and restart the external authentication configuration.

Also select which user group will have general administrator privileges in the Mission Portal. This group will be able to access the Mission Portal settings and configuration tools.

@node Directory structure, , Configure Active Directory, Configuration of external authentication
@section Directory structure

The Mission Portal imposes some limitations on directory structure for the use of external authentication. All users have to be stored in a direct child directory of the root (base dn). You may use subdirectories if you need to organize users into categories, but do not put more than one user directory directly under the root (base dn) as the user search will only cover the first encountered directory.

The same counts for group directories.
