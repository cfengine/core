/**
  @brief Buffer implementation

  The buffer structure acts as a byte container. It can contains any bytes and it is not restricted to
  C strings (by default it acts as a C String).

  If an error arises while doing something, we do everything we can to restore things to its previous state.
  Unfortunately not all errors are recoverable. Since we do not have a proper errno system, we just return -1.
