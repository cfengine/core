This promise is part of the xml-editing model. It assures that
an attribute, with the given name, will not be present in the
specified region within the xml file. If the attribute is found,
the default promise is to remove the attribute, from within the
specified region. The specified region is determined by
body-attributes. The promise object referred to is a literal
string representation of the name of the attribute to be deleted.
