@i{History}: Was introduced in 3.4.0, Enterprise 3.0.0 (2012)

This command allows CFEngine to detect default architecture of
packages managed by package manager. As an example, multiarch-enabled
dpkg only lists architectures explicitly for multiarch-enabled
packages.

In case this command is not provided, CFEngine treats all packages
without explicit architecture set as belonging to implicit ``default''
architecture.
