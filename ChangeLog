	Help text of cf-report -r corrected - a list of key hashes is
	required, not ip addresses.

	New Emacs mode for CFEngine policy files (thanks to Ted Zlatanov!)

	Full list of issues fixed is available on
	https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php

	Class setting in the promise types insert_lines, delete_lines,
	replace_patterns, field_edits, vars, classes is restored.

	New functions parse{read,int,string}array to match read{read,int,string}array.

	Some urgent patches to 3.1.3.
	Class validation parse bug fixed.
	Global zone handling error for solaris fixed.
	Package architectures handled correctly (bug #456).
	Reading and writing of key name "root-.pub" eliminated (bug #442, #453).
	cf-serverd crash because of race condition on SERVER_KEYSEEN fixed.

	The daemons now show no growth even with very complex policies.

	cf-serverd crash due to race condition in DeleteScope() fixed (bug #406).

	Added 30 second timeout on recv() on Linux.

	package_noverify_returncode implemented (bug #256).

	A flexible mechanism for setting classes based on return codes of
	commands has been introduced. Allows for setting promise kept,
	repaired or failed based on any return codes. This is currently
	implemented for commands-promises, package-manager commands and
	transformer in files. In classes body, see attributes
	kept_returncodes, repaired_returncodes, failed_returncodes (bug
	#248, #329).

	New function ip2host - reverse DNS lookup (bug #146).

3.1.2   (Scalability/efficiency release)

	Big efficiency improvements by caching output from
	cf-promises. Can also be used for much more efficent policy
	deployment (only pull if changed).

	Caching state of ps command for greater efficiency. Reloaded for each bundle.

	Index class lookup improves efficiency of class evaluation for huge configurations.

        Fixed issue where certain promiser strings got corrupted.

3.1.1   (Bugfix release)

	Memory leaks in server tracked down and fixed.

	cf-key -s command for showing key hash/IP address identity pairs

3.1.0
	Change in storage of public keys. Cfengine now hashes the public key and uses this
	as the keyname. Keys will be converted automatically.

	The old dynamic addresses lists are deprecated.
	Caching of dns and key information for greater server speed.
	Change in last-seen format reflects the public key usage.

	New package policy addupdate - installs package if not there and
	updates it otherwise.

	Support for package_changes => "bulk" in file repository as well.

	New special function readstringarrayidx, similar to readstringarray,
	but uses integer indeces. Very useful if first row elements are
	not good identifiers (e.g. contains spaces, non-unique, etc.).

	Change two log formats to use time() instead of date()
	- filechanges
	- total compliance

	Change from using md5 to sha256 as default digest for commercial version,
	community retains md5 for compat.

	Commands not returning 0 in commands-promises are flagged
	as repair_failed.

	Adjustable timeout on connect(). Defaults to 10 seconds, adjustable
	with default_timeout in agent control.

	Redesign of the knowledge map infrastructure.

	Now possible to use variables to call methods, e.g

	methods:

	  "name $(list)" usebundle => $(list)("abc");

	See reference manual notes

	Changes to normal ordering to optimize execution.

	Increased stability by always initializing Attribute and Promise
	structures.

	When running cf-promises in dry-run mode (-n), the user does not need
	to put binaries in WORKDIR/bin. For example, non-privileged users can verify root
	policies.

	Source control revision added in version string if run in verbose mode
	(e.g. "cf-promises -vV"). This needs some refining, uses revision of a header now.

	New semantics in return values of list functions. Null values are now allowed
	and there is no iteration over empty lists. The value "cf_null" is reserved for
	use as a null iterator.

3.0.5p1
        Showing paths allowed/denied access to when cf-serverd is run in verbose mode.
	Bug in server fixed for dynamic addresses.
	File handle closure bugfix - too many open databases.
	Seg fault in mount files fix.
	Twin used in cf-execd without checking.
	Check_root set wrong directory permissions at source not destination.
	Error message degraded in body definition.
	Undefined body not warned as error.
	Various build enahncements.
	Package_list_update called only once per manager, and fixed crash.
	Version number bug in packages.

3.0.5
        Encryption problems fixed - client key buffer was uninitialized.

        Classes-promisers are now automatically canonified when class
	strings are defined, to simplifying the use of variables in classes.

        New scalars sys.cf_version and sys.nova_version that hold Cfengine version information.

        Attribute package_delete_convention added, to allow customizable
	package name in delete command during update.

	package_list_update_ifelapsed limit added.

	Private variable $(firstrepo) is available in package_name_convention
        and package_delete_convention in order to expand the full path to
	a package, which is required by some managers.

	Some of the threading code is rewritten and made more robust. This includes
     	synchronizing access to the lastseen database from the server.

        Bad initialization of BSD flags fixed
	Multiple variable expansion issues in control fixed for server and agent
	Allow ignore_missing_bundles to affect methods: bundles too
	Run agent trust dialogue fixed

	Bug in CPU monitoring, increasing time scale caused linear decay
	of CPU measurement.

	Bug in Setuid log storage, fix.

	Hooks added for new Nova virtualization promises.

	Multithreading mutex failed to collide during cfservd leading to dropped authentication under heavy load.


3.0.4
	Class cancellation in promises to create better class feedback,
	allows emulation of switch/case semantics etc

	Value of SA measurement promises

	Special function getenv() which returns the contents of an
	environment variable (on all platforms).
	New function translatepath for generic Windows
	New function escape() to escape literals as regular expressions (like SQL)
        New function host2ip for caching IP address lookup
	New function regextract for setting variables with backreferences

	New variables for the components $(sys.cf_agent), $(sys.cf_know) etc
	pointing to the binaries.

	More robust integrated database implementation; closing all
	handles when receiving signals, self-healing on corruption.

	Package installation on localhost without a manager like yum completed,
	multiple repositories searched, and universal methods.

	Numerous bugfixes


3.0.3
	sha256 .. new hashes in openssl included in syntax tree.

	End of line autocropping in readfile (hopefully intelligent)

	hashmatch function incorrectly implemented - old debugging code left behind. Fix.

	sys.crontab variable

	Unknown user is now interpretated as "same user", so that we give cfengine a chance to
	fix

	Unregistered addresses no longer report "(Non registered IP)", but return as the address
	itself when doing reverse lookups.

3.0.2
	IMPORTANT: Change in normal ordering of editing. replace comes
	after insert lines Much testing and minor bug fixing

	Memory leaks fixed
	Many hooks added for Nova enterprise extensions.

        promise_output reports now placed in WORKDIR/reports directory

	Initialization correction and self-correx in monitord

	Many new body constraints added.

	Code readied for enterprise version Nova.

	-b option can override the bundlesequence (must not contain parameters yet)

	collapse_destination_dir option added to copy so that files can be
	aggregated from subdirectories into a single destination.
