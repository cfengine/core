A way of incorporating templates with variable expansion into file
operations. Variables should be named and scoped appropriately for the
bundle in which this promise is made. i.e. you should qualify the variables
with the bundle in which they are defined:

@verbatim
$(bundle.variable)
$(sys.host)
$(mon.www_in)
@end verbatim

In cfengine 2 @code{editfiles} this was called @samp{ExpandVariables}.
