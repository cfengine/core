This promise is part of the xml-editing model. It assures that a
value string, containing the matching substring, will be present
in the specified region within the xml file. If the substring is not
found, the default promise is to append the substring at the end of
the existing value string, within the specified region. The specified
region is determined by body-attributes. The promise object referred
to is a literal string of text.
