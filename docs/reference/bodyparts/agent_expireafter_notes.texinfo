@noindent Sets a maximum time on any run of the command in @code{exec_command}.
If no data is received from the pipe opened to the process created with
@code{exec_command} after the time has elapsed, the process gets killed.

@noindent Note that if you have long-running jobs, they may get killed
with this setting. Therefore, you should ensure it is higher than any run of
@code{cf-agent} that you want to leave alone. Alternatively, you can make
your jobs output something to STDOUT at least as often as this threshold.
This will reset the timer.

@noindent The setting will effectively allow you to set a threshold on the
number of simultaneous agents that are running. For example, if you set it to
@code{120} and you are using a 5-minute agent schedule, a maximum of
120 / 5 = 24 agents should be enforced.
