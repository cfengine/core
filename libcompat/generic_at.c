/*
 * This function uses fchdir() to preserve integrity when querying
 * a file from a directory descriptor. It's ugly but it's the only way
 * to be secure.
 * Using fchdir() in *at functions means that we can potentially
 * conflict with chdir()/fchdir() being used elsewhere. For this to be
 * safe, the program must fulfill at least one of the following
 * criteria:
 *   1. Be single threaded.
 *   2. Not use chdir() anywhere else but here.
 *   3. Do all file operations (including chdir) in one thread.
 *   4. Use the CHDIR_LOCK in this file.
 * Currently, cf-agent fulfills criterion 1. All the others fulfill
 * criterion 2.
