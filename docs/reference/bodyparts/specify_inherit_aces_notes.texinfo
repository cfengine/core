 @code{specify_default_aces} (optional) is a list of access control
  entries that are set on child objects. It is also parsed from left
  to right and allows multiple entries with same entity-type and
  id. Only valid if @code{acl_default} is set to
  @code{specify}.

This is an acl which makes explicit setting for the acl inherited by
new objects within a directory. It is included for those implementations
that do not have a clear inheritance policy.
