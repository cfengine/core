This directory contains kindly donated work by other inviduals
who use cfengine. An alternative and more official GNU makefile
setup is included here, courtesy of  Knut-HÃ¥vard Aksnes.
I haven't used them yet, because I like the makefiles which I
and David Masterson have worked out -- they leave the screen
tidier.

Things in this directory are for your pleasure and for
future work, but I am not responsible for them, nor do I
maintain them.
