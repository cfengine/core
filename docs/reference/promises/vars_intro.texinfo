Variables in CFEngine are defined as promises that an identifier
represents a particular value. Variables in CFEngine are dynamically
typed as strings, integers and real numbers. Lists of these types
are also possible.

CFEngine supports a few operations on arrays. Arrays are simply a
naming convention for scalar variables, using square brackets @samp{[]}
to enclose an arbitrary key. Arrays are thus @code{associative}.
