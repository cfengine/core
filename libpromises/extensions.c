/*
 * A note regarding the loading of the extension plugins:
 *
 * The extension plugin was originally statically linked into each agent,
 * but was then refactored into plugins.
 * Therefore, since it hasn't been written according to plugin guidelines,
 * it is not safe to assume that we can unload it once we have
 * loaded it, since it may allocate resources that are not freed. It is also
 * not safe to assume that we can load it after initialization is complete
 * (for example if the plugin is dropped into the directory after cf-serverd
 * has already been running for some time), because some data structures may
 * not have been initialized.
 *
 * Therefore, the load strategy is as follows:
 *
 * - If we find the plugin immediately, load it, and keep it loaded.
 *
 * - If we don't find the plugin, NEVER attempt to load it again afterwards.
 *
 * - Never unload the plugin.
 *
 * - Any installation/upgrade/removal of the plugin requires daemon restarts.
 *
 * - The exception is for testing (see getenv below).
