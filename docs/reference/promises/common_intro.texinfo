Most promise bodies belong to one and only one type of promise.  The
generic `*' promises bodies can be added to any promise type in
@code{cf-agent}, hence the star which means (for this documentation
only) `any'.


The body attributes described below can thus be added to any promise rule
in the agent. These promises address matters of a completely general
nature -- how CFEngine behaves as it attempts to keep a promise,
comments about the promises etc.
