How to contribute
-----------------

Thanks for considering contributing to the CFEngine! We take pull-requests on GitHub at
http://github.com/cfengine, and we have a public Redmine bug-tracker at http://bug.cfengine.com

Normally, bug fixes have a higher chance of getting accepted than new features, but we certainly
welcome feature contributions. If you have an idea for a new feature, it might be a good
idea to open up a feature ticket in Redmine first to get discussion going.


Top reasons pull-requests are rejected or delayed
-------------------------------------------------

* Code does not follow style guidlines.

* Pull request addresses several disperate issues. In general, smaller pull-requests are better
because they are easier to review and stay mergable longer.

* Messy commit log. Tidy up the commit log by squashing commits. Write good commit messages:
One line summary at the top, followed by an optional detailing paragraphs. Please reference
Redmine tickets, e.g. "Close #1234"

* Code is out-of-date, does not compile, or does not pass all tests. Again, focused and small
pull-requests are better.

* No attached test case. Normally, all new code needs test cases. This means a functional test
runnable with 'make check'.


Emacs users
-----------

There is Elisp snippet in contrib/cfengine-code-style.el which defines the
project's coding style. Please use it when working with source code. The easiest
way to do so is to add

 (add-to-list 'load-path "<core checkout directory>/contrib")
 (require 'cfengine-code-style)

and run

 ln -s contrib/dir-locals.el .dir-locals.el

in the top directory of the source code checkout.
