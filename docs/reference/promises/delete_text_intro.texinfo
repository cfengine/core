This promise is part of the xml-editing model. It assures that a
value string, containing the matching substring, will not be present
in the specified node within the xml file. If the substring is
found, the default promise is to remove the existing value string,
from within the specified node. The specified node is determined
by body-attributes. The promise object referred to is a literal
string of text.
