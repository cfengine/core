Note that typically, only a single xpath is built in each @code{build_xpath}
promise (you may of course have multiple promises that each build an xpath).
Also, please note that the supported syntax used in building an xpath is
currently limited to a simple and compact format, as shown in the above
example. The xpath must begin with '/', as it is verified and built using
an absolute path, from the root node of the document.
