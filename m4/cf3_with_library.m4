# CF3_WITH_LIBRARY(library-name, checks)
# --------------------------------------

# This function popluates CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS from the
# --with-$library=PATH and runs a second argument with those options.
#
# After execution flags are returned to previous state, but available in
# ${LIBRARY}_{CFLAGS,LDFLAGS}. Path is available in ${LIBRARY}_PATH.
#
# Libraries added to LIBS are available as ${LIBRARY}_LIBS afterwards.
