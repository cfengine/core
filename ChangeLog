	- Add testing jUnit and TAP bundles and include them in stdlib.cf
	- New function isipinsubnet() (ENT-7949)
	- LogDebug(): implement module-based debug logging.
	  Now most DEBUG messages are *not* printed even when "-d" is in use, but

	  example to enable all log modules, run:
	  cf-agent -d --log-modules=all
	- Add: edit_line contains_literal_string to stdlib

	- policy_server.dat now appends a newline and supports host & port

	Changes:
	- Rewrite iteration engine to avoid combinatorial explosion with nested variable expansions.
	  This speeds up enormously the execution of policies that included long
	  slists or JSON containers, that in the past didn't even terminate.
	  Change: "cf_null" string literal was changed to not be something
	          special, and it's now a string that can be used anywhere, like
	          in slists or part of bundlesequence etc.
	  NOTE: Old policy should be grep'ed for "cf_null" and in case such
	        occurences were handled specially, they should be reworked.
	  Change: "--empty-list--" is now never printed by format(),
	          an empty list is now printed as "{  }".
	  Change: Order of pre-evaluation was slightly changed, A new "vars" pass
	          at the beginning of pre-evaluation was added. It used to be
	          classes-vars, but it was changed to vars-classes-vars. As a
	          result some classes or variables might be evaluated at a
	          different time than before. As always try to write policy code that works no matter what the
	          order of execution is.
	          One way is to always *guard* the execution of functions to avoid
	          bogus function results.  For example the following will avoid
	          running execresult() bevore the file has been created:
	            execresult("cmd /path/to/filename") if => fileexists("/path/to/filename");
	  C internals: NULL Rlist is now perfectly valid, in fact it is the only
	               way to denote an empty Rlist.
	  C internals: Since a slist variable can be NULL, API of
	               EvalContextVariableGet() changed: The way to detect if a
	               variable is found, is not to check return value for NULL,
	               but to check returned *type* for CF_DATA_TYPE_NONE.
	               Fixed what I could find as wrong API uses. (CFE-2162)
	- Allow arbitrary service policies (CFE-2402)
	- Behaviour change: cf-execd: Do not append -Dfrom_cfexecd to exec_command .
	  (CFE-2386)
	- Failsafe/Bootstrap no longer copy files starting with .git (like .gitignore) or .mailmap
	  (CFE-2439)

	- Change: Enable agent component management policy on systemd hosts
	  (CFE-2429)
	- Change: Switch processes restart_class logging to verbose
	- Change: Log level for keeping verbatim JSON to DEBUG (CFE-2141)
	- Change: Require network before cfengine services (CFE-2435)
	- Behaviour change: getvalues(inexistent_var) returns an empty list.
	  Restores 3.7.x and earlier behaviour. (CFE-2479)
	- Behaviour change: when used with CFEngine 3.10.0 or greater,
	  bundles set_config_values() and set_line_based() are appending a
	  trailing space when inserting a configuration option with empty value.
	  (CFE-2466)
	- Behaviour change: getvalues() always returns a list now. Even when v is a simple
	  string (i.e. not an iterable) it will return an slist with one element:
	  the value of the string variable.
	- Behaviour change: readintlist() now prints an error if the
	  file contains real numbers, not integers, and aborts; previously it was
	  printing an info-level error message, was half-reading an integer out of
	  the real, and was continuing successfully.
	- Ensure synchronous start and stop with systemctl (ENT-2841)
	- Change select_region INI_section to match end of section or end of file
	  (CFE-2519)

	  if there was no previous output log and the new log was fully filtered
	  by email filters. (ENT-2739)

	- define kept outcome with action warn if edit_line is as expected
	  (CFE-2424)
	- Example using getvariablemetatags() and getclassmetatags() to get a specific tag key
	- Remove 2k limit on strings length when writing JSON policies
	  (CFE-2383)

	- Allow editing fields in lines longer than 4k (CFE-2438)
	- Don't send empty emails for logs where everything is filtered.
	  (ENT-2739)
	- allow maplist(), maparray(), and mapdata() to evaluate function calls during iteration
	  (ARCHIVE-1619)

	  end of the region if 'select_end' pattern is not matched . (CFE-2263)
	- Change: Remove executable bit from systemd units (CFE-2436)
	- cf-serverd should reload def.json when reloading policy (CFE-2406)
	- Fix cf-monitord detection of usernames of the process table on AIX.
	- Speed up local and remote file copying and fix spurious errors.
	  (ENT-2769)
	- Fix occasional segfault when running getindices() on a
	  variable that has indices of multiple depths (e.g. both "a[x]" and
	  "a[x][y]"). (CFE-2397)
	- When no file is provided when calling cf-promises
	  with cf or json output, use promises.cf by default. This restores the
	  previous behavior. (CFE-2375)
	- Fix: Services starting or stopping unnecessarily (CFE-2421)
	- Change: Split systemd units (CFE-2278)
	- EOF is  matched as an end of the region in edit_line
	  promises only if 'select_end_match_eof' parameter is true. (CFE-2263)
	- Fix double logging of output_prefix, and log process name for cf-agent syslog messages.
	  (CFE-2225)
	- Be less verbose if a network interface doesn't have a MAC address.

	- Fix: CFEngine choking on standard services (CFE-2806)
	- fix insert_lines related memory corruption (CFE-2520)
	- fix cf-serverd crash when reporting corrupted data. (ENT-3023)
	- Fix ability to manage INI sections with metachars for
	  manage_variable_values_ini and set_variable_values_ini (CFE-2519)
	- Fix apt_get package module incorrectly using interactive mode.
	- Fix crash on Solaris when ps ucb variant is not available. (CFE-2506)
	- cf-serverd: Do not close connection when file does not exist.
	  (CFE-2532)
	- getvalues() now behaves correctly for old CFEngine arrays of depth 1.
	  Known issues: getvalues() still misbehaves with double-indexed arrays
	  (see (CFE-2504, CFE-2536)

3.9.0:
	New features/additions:
	- Add optional interface parameter to iprange() to match only one interface.
	- Allow '=' in symbolic modes (Redmine #7826)
	- Add: FreeBSD ports package module
	- New package module for FreeBSD pkg package manager.
	- Add support for adding/removing fifos in policy
	- Add Linux parsing of /proc/net/ data.
	  - sys.inet
	  - sys.inet6
	  - sys.interface_data
	  - Data is returned as a data container.
	  - See documentation for more details. (Jira CFE-1991)
	- sys.ip2iface: new reverse mapping variable from IP to interface name
	- Namespaced classes can now be specified on the command line.
	- namespaces can now be passed to cf-runagent -D and --remote-bundles
	  (Redmine #7856)
	- Add 'cf-full' and 'json-full' to cf-promises '-p' option.
	  They generate output based on the entire policy. The existing 'cf'
	  already behaved this way, and it has now been changed to generate
	  output only for a single file, which the existing 'json' option
	  already does.
	- New language functions: processexists() and findprocesses()
	  (Redmine #7633)
	- Implement new regex_replace() function. (Redmine #7346)
	- Add log rotation policy for state/classes.jsonl log. (Redmine #7951)
	- Added collect_vars utility bundle to stdlib
	- Intoduce report_class_log attribute to body agent control.
	  (Redmine #7951)
	- Add standard_services service_method allowing for explicit usage
	- cf-promises --show-vars can now show JSON variables.
	- Add json_pipe mode to mapdata(), which allows piping a
	  JSON container to an external program for manipulation and receiving
	  JSON back. The `jq` tool is a good example where this mode can be
	  useful. A corresponding `$(def.jq)` variable has also been added with
	  a default path to this tool. See documentation for mapdata() for
	  more information and examples. (Jira CFE-2071)
	- behaviour change: "true" is always defined and "false" is never defined in a context expression.
	- Add: nimclient package module for AIX
	  This module provides basic functionality for using nimclient as a means
	  to ensure packages are either present or absent. It does not support
	  listing package updates available or provide any special caching.
	- Add callstack_callers() and callstack_promisers() functions.
	- Log variable definitions in debug output. (Redmine #7137)
	- Add: Memory information to host info report (Jira CFE-1177)
	- In Mustache templates, one can now use `{{#-top-}}` and
	  `{{/-top-}}` tags to iterate over the top level element in a
	  container. (Redmine #6545)
	- Add network_connections() function that parses /proc/net
	- Provide new -w argument to override the workdir for testing
	- New feature: Emails sent by cf-execd can be filtered to get
	  rid of emails for unwanted log messages. The attributes
	  mailfilter_include and mailfilter_exclude in body executor
	  control control what to include. See documentation for cf-execd for
	  more information. (Jira CFE-2283)
	- Add: file_make_mustache bundle to render mustache templates
	- Add '-n' flag to cf-key to avoid host name lookups.
	- cf-agent, cf-execd, cf-promises, cf-runagent and cf-serverd honor multiple -D, -N and -s arguments
	  (Redmine #7191)
	- Add "canonify" mode to mapdata().
	- Add: printfile bodies to stdlib
	- Add: New `results` classes body [] (Redmine #7418, #7481)
	- Implement cf-runagent --remote-bundles and cf-serverd "bundle" access promise.
	  (Redmine #7581)
	- Add commands promise arglist attribute, augmenting args attribute.
	- It's now possible to reference variables in inline JSON,
	  for example: `mergedata('[ thing, { "mykey": otherthing[123] } ]')`.
	  `thing` and `otherthing[123]` will be resolved as variables, since
	  they are unquoted. See the documentation for more details.
	  (Redmine #7871)
	- Allow inline JSON to be used in the following function
	  calls:
	  - data_expand()
	  - difference()
	  - every()
	  - filter()
	  - format()
	  - getindices()
	  - getvalues()
	  - grep()
	  - intersection()
	  - join()
	  - length()
	  - makerule()
	  - mapdata()
	  - maplist()
	  - mean()
	  - mergedata()
	  - none()
	  - nth()
	  - parsejson()
	  - product()
	  - regarray()
	  - reglist()
	  - reverse()
	  - shuffle()
	  - some()
	  - sort()
	  - storejson()
	  - string_mustache()
	  - sublist()
	  - sum()
	  - unique()
	  - url_get()
	  - variance()
	  For example: `mergedata('[ "thing", { "mykey": "myvalue" } ]')`
	  See the documentation for more details. (Jira CFE-2253)
	- Add: edit_line contains_literal_string to stdlib
	- Add body agent control select_end_match_eof option. (Jira CFE-2390)

	Changes:
	- Change: classesmatching(): order of classes changed
	- Change: getindices(), getvalues(), variablesmatching(), maparray():
	  order of variables returned has changed
	- Change: set_quoted_values uses bundle scoped classes
	- Change: set_config_values uses bundle scoped classes
	- Change: set_variable_values uses bundle scoped classes
	- Change: set_config_values_matching uses bundle scoped classes
	- Change: manage_variable_values_ini uses bundle scoped classes
	- Change: set_line_based should use bundle scoped classes
	  (Jira CFE-1959)
	- getvalues() will now return a list also for data containers,
	  and will descend recursively into the containers. (Redmine #7116)
	- Change: Improve git drop user support
	- Use new package promise as default package promise
	  implementation. (Jira CFE-2332)
	- Don't follow symbolic links when copying extended attributes.
	- When a bodydefault:<promise_type>_<body_type> body is
	  defined, it will be used by all promises of type <promise_type>
	  unless another body is explicitly used.
	- cf-serverd no longer appends "-I -Dcfruncommand" to
	             cfruncommand, this has to be done manually in masterfiles
	             body server control. (Redmine #7732)
	- eval() function arguments mode and options are now
	  optional.
	- sort() function argument mode is now optional.
	- Change: returnszero() no longer outputs the output of a command.
	  The output can be seen by enabling info mode (-I).
	- cfruncommand is not executed under shell. (Redmine #7409)
	- Remove: Apache CGI module
	- Change: Make maxbytes arg of readjson() and readyaml() optional
	- Classes matching agent control's abortclasses are
	  now printed before exit, even if they are defined in common bundles.
	  Previously the regex (in abortclasses) that matched the class was
	  printed if the class was defined in a common bundle, but the class
	  itself was printed if it was defined in an agent bundle. With this
	  change, the defined class that caused the abort is always printed.
	- Remove: Support for email settings from augments_file (Redmine #7682)
	- Change: set_variable_values_ini uses bundle scoped classes
	- findfiles() now skips relative paths. (Redmine #7981)
	- Clients connections using non TLS protocol are rejected
	  by default. . (Jira CFE-2339)
	- Change: Policy files specified in the "inputs" section of
	  def.json will no longer be auto-loaded. One has to refer to the
	  which are using the "inputs" field inside def.json. (Redmine #7961)
	- Change: Separate binary details from policy update (Redmine #7662)
	- Add guard for binary upgrade during bootstrap (Redmine #7861)
	- Change: Modernize pkg module and package_method
	- Remove: Userdir apache module
	- filestat(path, "linktarget") now follows non-absolute links and returns full path of target.
	  This introduces a change in behaviour. Here is an example:
	  $ ls -l /bin/sh
	  lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Jun  4  2015 /bin/sh -> dash
	  Previously the filestat function would return "dash", and would also log
	  an error that the file can not be read. Now it will return "/bin/dash"
	  (or the final destination if it happens that /bin/dash is also a
	  symlink).
	  You can still get the previous behaviour by using
	  filestat(path, "linktarget_shallow"). (Redmine #7404)
	- Define (bootstrap|failsafe)_mode during update.cf when triggerd from failsafe.cf
	  (Redmine #7861)
	- Behavior change: The promise string of a processes
	  promise now matches just the command line of each process instead of
	  the line that is output by ps. This was done to reduce fragmentation
	  between platforms, since ps is a very nonstandardized tool.
	  (Jira CFE-2161)
	- Allowed namespace names made more strict, to disallow
	  namespaces that cannot be reached. (Redmine #7903)
	- Behavior change: When using readintlist(), readreallist()
	  or readstringlist(), parsing an empty file will no longer result in a
	  failed function call, but instead an empty list. Failure to open the
	  file will still result in a failed function call.
	- insert_lines is no longer implicitly matching EOF as
	  end of the region if 'select_end' pattern is not matched .
	  (Jira CFE-2263)
	- EOF is  matched as an end of the region in edit_line
	  promises only if 'select_end_match_eof' parameter is true.
	  (Jira CFE-2263)

	- Fix file descriptor leak when there are network errors.
	- Improve robustness of process table parsing on Solaris.
	  (Jira CFE-2161)
	- Installing packages containing version numbers using yum
	  now works correctly. (Redmine #7825)

3.8.2:
	Fixes:
	- Update library dependencies to latest version.
	  Libraries upgraded:
	  - curl 7.47.0
	  - LMDB 0.9.18
	  - MySQL 5.1.72
	  - OpenLDAP 2.4.44
	  - OpenSSL 1.0.2g
	  - PostgreSQL 9.3.11
	  - Redis 3.0.7
	  - rsync 3.1.2
	  PHP was kept at 5.6.17 because of problems with the 5.6.19 version.
	- Reduce verbosity of apt_get package module (Redmine #7485)
	- Reduce verbosity of yum package module (Redmine #7485)
	- The isvariable() function call now correctly accepts all
	  array variables when specified inline. Previously it would not accept
	  certain special characters, even though they could be specified
	  indirectly by using a variable to hold it. (Redmine #7088)
	- Don't follow symbolic links when copying extended attributes.
	- Fix a bug which sometimes caused package promises to be
	  skipped with "XX Another cf-agent seems to have done this since I
	  started" messages in the log, most notably in long running cf-agent
	  runs (longer than one minute). (Redmine #7933)
	- Fix bug which could render host unable to recover from a
	  syntax error, even if failsafe.cf was utilized. This could happen if
	  the file containing the syntax error was specified in the def.json
	  special file. (Redmine #7961)
	- Change: Policy files specified in the "inputs" section of
	  def.json will no longer be auto-loaded. One has to refer to the
	  $(def.augments_inputs) variable in the policy (the standard
	  masterfiles policies include this by default). This only affects
	  installations which are not based on the standard masterfiles, and
	  which are using the "inputs" field inside def.json. (Redmine #7961)
	- Fix file descriptor leak when there are network errors.
	- Fix cf-serverd error messages with classic protocol clients
	  (Redmine #7818)

	  when doing a local file copy. Errors could happen when copying
	  across two different mount points where the support for extended
	  attributes is different between the mount points.
	- Fix classes being set because of hash collision in the implementation.
	  (Redmine #7912)
	- Allow def.json up to 5MB instead of 4K.
	- Fix a regression which would sometimes cause "Permission
	  denied" errors on files inside directories with very restricted
	  permissions. (Redmine #7808)
	- Change: Suppress standard services noise on SUSE (Redmine #6968)

	- Define (bootstrap|failsafe)_mode during update.cf when triggerd from failsafe.cf
	  (Redmine #7861)


3.8.0:
	New features/additions:
	- New feature: Bodies can now inherit attribute values from
	  other bodies by specifying "inherit_from" with the name of the body to
	  inherit from, plus any arguments it accepts. For example:
	    body classes myclasses
	    {
	        inherit_from => classes_generic("myname");
	    }
	    (Redmine #4309)

	  primitive. The old behavior, when iterating across a map or array of
	  maps, was to abort if the key was requested with {{@}}. The new
	  behavior is to always replace {{@}} with either the key name or the
	  iteration position in the array. An error is printed if {{@}} is used
	  outside of a Mustache iteration section.
	- Fix build with musl libc. (Redmine #7455)
	- Fixed a bug which could cause daemons to not to be killed
	  correctly when upgrading or manually running "service cfengine3 stop".

        - eval() can now be called with "class" as the "mode" argument, which
          will cause it to return true ("any") if the calculated result is
          non-zero, and false ("!any") if it is zero.
        - New list_ifelse() function
        - New mapdata() function as well as JSON support in maparray().

          alias.
        - Ability to expand JSON variables directory in Mustache templates:
          Prefix the name with '%' for multiline expansion, '$' for compact
          expansion.
        - Ability to expand the iteration *key* in Mustache templates with @
        - Canonical JSON output: JSON output has reliably sorted keys so the
          same data structure will produce the same JSON every time.
        - New "@if minimum_version(x.x)" syntax in order to hide future language
          improvements from versions that don't understand them.
        - compile time option (--with-statedir) to
          override the default state/ directory path.
        - Fix error messages/ handling in process signalling which no longer
          allowed any signals to fail silently
        - Also enable shortcut keyword for cf-serverd classic protocol, eg to
          simplify the bootstrap process for clients that have different
          sys.masterdir settings (Redmine #3697)
        - methods promises now accepts the bundle name in the promiser string,
          as long as it doesn't have any parameters.
        - In a services promise, if the service_method bundle is not specified,
          it defaults to the promiser string (canonified) with "service_" as a
          prefix. The bundle must be in the same namespace as the promise.
        - inline JSON in policy files: surrounding with parsejson() is now
          optional *when creating a new data container*.
        - New data_expand() function to interpolate variables in a data container.
        - Add configurable network bandwidth limit for all outgoing
          connections ("bwlimit" attribute in "body common control") . To
          enforce it in both directions, make sure the attribute is set on both
          sides of the connection.
        - Secure bootstrap has been facilitated by use of
          "cf-agent --boostrap HUB_ADDRESS --trust-server=no"
        - Implement new TLS-relevant options (Redmine #6883):
          - body common control: tls_min_version
          - body server control: allowtlsversion
          - body common control: tls_ciphers
          - body server control: allowciphers (preexisting)

        Changes:
        - Improved output format, less verbose, and messages are grouped.
        - cf-execd: agent_expireafter default was changed to 120 minutes
          (Redmine #7113)
        - All embedded databases are now rooted in the state/ directory.
        - TLS used as default for all outgoing connections.
        - process promise now reports kept status instead of repaired if a
          signal is not sent, even if the restart_class is set. The old
          behavior was to set the repaired status whenever the process was not
          running. (Redmine#7216).
        - Bootstrapping requires keys to be generated in advance using cf-key.
        - Disable class set on reverse lookup of interfaces IP addresses.
          (Redmine #3993, Redmine #6870)
        - Define a hard class with just the OS major version on FreeBSD.
        - Abort cf-agent if OpenSSL's random number generator can't
          be seeded securely.
        - Masterfiles source tarball now installs using the usual commands
          "./configure; make install".
        - Updated Emacs syntax highlighting template to support the latest
          syntax enhancements in 3.7.

        Deprecations:
        - Arbitrary arguments to cfruncommand (using "cf-runagent -o") are
          not acceptable any more. (Redmine #6978)
        - 3.4 is no longer supported in masterfiles.

        Bug fixes:
        - Fix server common bundles evaluation order (Redmine#7211).
        - Limit LMDB disk usage by preserving sparse areas in LMDB files
          (Redmine#7242).
        - Fixed LMDB corruption on HP-UX 11.23. (Redmine #6994)
        - Fixed insert_lines failing to converge if preserve_block was used.
          (Redmine #7094)
        - Fixed init script failing to stop/restart daemons on openvz/lxc
          hosts. (Redmine #3394)
        - rm_rf_depth now deletes base directory as advertised. (Redmine #7009)
        - Refactored cf-agent's connection cache to properly differentiate
          hosts using all needed attributes like host and port.
          (Redmine #4646)
        - Refactored lastseen database handling to avoid inconsistencies.
          (Redmine #6660)
        - cf-key --trust-key now supports new syntax to also update the
          lastseen database, so that clients using old protocol will trust
          the server correctly.
        - Fixed a bug which sometimes caused an agent or daemon to kill or stop
          itself. (Redmine #7075, #7244)
        - Fixed a bug which made it difficult to kill CFEngine daemons,
          particularly cf-execd. (Redmine #6659, #7193)
        - Fixed a bug causing systemd not to be detected correctly on Debian.
          (Redmine #7297)
        - "cf-promises -T" will now correctly report the checked out commit,
          even if you haven't checked out a Git branch. (Redmine #7332)
        - Reduce verbosity of harmless errors related to socket timeouts and
          missing thermal zone files. (Redmine #6486 and #7238)

        Masterfiles:

        Added:
        - Support for user specified overring of framework defaults without
          modifying policy supplied by the framework itself (see
          example_def.json)
        - Support for def.json class augmentation in update policy
        - Run vacuum operation on postgresql every night as a part of
          maintenance.
        - Add measure_promise_time action body to lib (3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8)
        - New negative class guard `cfengine_internal_disable_agent_email` so
          that agent email can be easily disabled by augmenting def.json

        Changed:
        - Relocate def.cf to controls/VER/
        - Relocate update_def to controls/VER
        - Relocate all controls to controls/VER
        - Only load cf_hub and reports.cf on CFEngine Enterprise installs
        - Relocate acls related to report collection from bundle server
          access_rules to controls/VER/reports.cf into bundle server
          report_access_rules
        - Re-organize cfe_internal splitting core from enterprise specific
          policies and loading the appropriate inputs only when necessary
        - Moved update directory into cfe_internal as it is not generally
          intended to be modified
        - services/autorun.cf moved to lib/VER/ as it is not generally intended
          to be modified
        - To improve predictibility autorun bundles are activated in
          lexicographical order
        - Relocate services/file_change.cf to cfe_internal/enterprise. This
          policy is most useful for a good OOTB experience with CFEngine
          Enterprise Mission Portal.
        - Relocate service_catalogue from promsies.cf to services/main.cf. It is
          intended to be a user entry. This name change correlates with the main
          bundle being activated by default if there is no bundlesequence
          specified.
        - Reduce benchmarks sample history to 1 day.
        - Update policy no longer generates a keypair if one is not found.
          (Redmine: #7167)
        - Relocate cfe_internal_postgresql_maintenance bundle to lib/VER/
        - Set postgresql_monitoring_maintenance only for versions 3.6.0 and
          3.6.1
        - Move hub specific bundles from lib/VER/cfe_internal.cf into
          lib/VER/cfe_internal_hub.cf and load them only if policy_server policy
          if set.
        - Re-organize lib/VER/stdlib.cf from lists into classic array for use
          with getvalues

        Removed:
        - Diff reporting on /etc/shadow (Enterprise)
        - Update policy from promise.cf inputs. There is no reason to include
          the update policy into promsies.cf, update.cf is the entry for the
          update policy
        - _not_repaired outcome from classes_generic and scoped_classes generic
          (Redmine: # 7022)

        Fixes:
        - standard_services now restarts the service if it was not already
          running when using service_policy => restart with chkconfig (Redmine
          #7258)


3.6.5:
        Features:
        - Introduced "systemd" hard class. (Redmine #6995)
        - Added paths to dtrace, zfs and zpool on FreeBSD in masterfiles.

        Bug fixes:
        - Fixed build error on certain RHEL5 and SLES10 setups. (Redmine #6841)
        - Fixed a bug which caused dangling symlinks not to be removed.
          (Redmine #6582)
        - Fixed data_readstringarrayidx function not preserving the order of the
          array it's producing. (Redmine #6920)
        - Fixed a bug which sometimes caused CFEngine to kill the wrong daemon
          if both the host and a container inside the host were running
          CFEngine. (Redmine #6906)
        - Made sure the rm_rf_depth bundle also deletes the base directory.
          (Redmine #7009)
        - Fixed monitord reporting wrongly on open ports. (Redmine #6926)
        - Skip adding the class when its name is longer than 1024 characters.
          Fixed core dump when the name is too large. (Redmine #7013)
        - Fixed detection of stopped process on Solaris. (Redmine #6946)
        - Fixed infinite loop (Redmine #6992) plus a couple more minor
          bugs in edit_xml promises.

3.6.4:
        Features:
        - Introduced users promises support on HP-UX platform.
        - Introduced process promises support on HP-UX platform.

        Bug fixes:
        - Fixed bug on FreeBSD which sometimes led to the wrong process being
          killed (Redmine #2330)
        - Fixed package version comparison sometimes failing with rpm package
          manager (Redmine #6807)
        - Fixed a bug in users promises which would sometimes set the wrong
          password hash if the user would also be unlocked at the same time.
        - Fixed a bug on AIX which would occasionally kill the wrong process.
        - Improved error message for functions that require an absolute path.
          (Redmine #6877)
        - Fixed some spelling errors in examples.
        - Fixed error in out-of-tree builds when building cf-upgrade.
        - Fixed a bug which would make cf-agent exit with an error if it was
          built with a custom log directory, and that directory did not exist.
        - Fixed ordering of evaluating promises when depends_on is used.
          (Redmine #6484, Redmine #5462)
        - Skip non-empty directories silently when recursively deleting.
          (Redmine #6331)

        - support for HP-UX 11.23 and later
        - experimental support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

          delete_lines never matches (Redmine #6589)
        - fix max_file_size => "0" not disabling or allowing any size
          (Redmine #6588)

          (Redmine #6369)
        - fix ifelapsed bug with bundle nesting (Redmine #6334)
        - fix handling cf_null in bundlesequence (Redmine #6119)
        - fix maparray reading whole input array when using subarray
          (Redmine #6033)

          string_upcase (Redmine #2912)

3.6.2
        Bug fixes:
        - don't regenerate software_packages.csv every time (Redmine #6441)
        - improve verbose message for package_list_command
        - fix missing log output on AIX (Redmine #6434)
        - assorted fixes to dirname() esp on Windows (Redmine #4716)
        - fix package manager detection
        - fix build issues on FreeBSD
        - allow copying of dead symbolic links (Redmine #6175)
        - preserve order in readstringarrayidx (Redmine #6466)
        - fix passing of unexpanded variable references to arrays
          (Redmine #5893)
        - use entries for new {admin,deny}_{ips,hostnames} constraints in
          the relevant legacy lists (Redmine #6542)
        - cope with ps's numeric fields overflowing to the right
        - interpret failing function calls in ifvarclass as class not set
          (Redmine #6327)
        - remove unexpanded lists when extending lists (Redmine #6541)
        - infer start-time of a process from elapsed when needed

        - 9999999999 (ten 9s) or higher has been historically used as an upper
          bound in CFEngine code and policy but because of overflow on 32-bit
          platforms it caused problems with big numbers. Fixed in two ways:
          first change all existing policy uses to 999999999 (nine 9s instead
          of eleven 9s), second fix the C code to not wrap-around in case of
          overflow, but use the LONG_MAX value (Redmine #6531).
        - cf-serverd and other daemons no longer reload their configuration
          every minute if CFEngine is built with an inputs directory outside
          of the work directory (not the default). (Redmine #6551)

3.6.1
        New features:
        - Introduced Solaris and AIX support into the 3.6 series, with many associated build and
          bug fixes.

	Changes:
        - Short-circuit evaluation of classes promises if class is already set (Redmine #5241)
        - fix to assume all non-specified return codes are failed in commands promises (Redmine #5986)
        - cf-serverd logs reconfiguration message to NOTICE (was INFO) so that it's always logged in syslog

	Bug fixes:
        - File monitoring has been completely rewritten (changes attribute in files promise), which
          eliminates many bugs, particularly regarding files that are deleted. Upgrading will keep
          all monitoring data, but downgrading again will reinitialize the DB, so all files will be
          reported as if they were new. (Redmine #2917)
        - $(this.promiser) expands in files promises for 'transformer', 'edit_template',
          'copy_from.source', 'file_select.exec_program', 'classes' and 'action' bodies
          (Redmine #1554, #1496, #3530, #1563)
        - 'body changes' notifies about disappeared files in file monitoring (Redmine #2917)
        - Fixed CFEngine template producing a zero sized file (Redmine #6088)
        - Add 0-9 A-Z _ to allowed context of module protocol (Redmine #6063)
        - Extend ps command column width and prepend zone name on Solaris
        - Fixed strftime() function on Solaris when called with certain specifiers.
        - Fixed users promise bug regarding password hashes in a NIS/NSS setup.
        - Fixed $(sys.uptime), $(sys.systime) and $(sys.sysday) in AIX. (Redmine #5148, #5206)
        - Fixed processes_select complaining about "Unacceptable model uncertainty examining processes" (Redmine #6337)
        - ps command for linux has been changed to cope with big rss values (Redmine #6337)
        - Address ps -axo shift on FreeBSD 10 and later (Redmine #5667)
        - methods and services promises respect action_policy => "warn" (Redmine #5924)
        - LMDB should no longer deadlock if an agent is killed on the hub while holding the DB lock.
          Note that the change only affects binary packages shipped by CFEngine, since the upstream
          LMDB project has not yet integrated the change. (Redmine #6013)

3.6.0

        Changes:
        - Changes to logging output
            - add process name and pid in syslog message (GitHub #789)
            - cf-serverd logging levels are now more standardised:
                  - INFO logs only failures
                  - VERBOSE logs successful requests as well
                  - DEBUG logs actual protocol traffic.
            - cf-serverd now logs the relevant client IP address on
              each message.
            - Logging contexts to local database (cf_classes.tcdb) has been deprecated.
            - 'usebundle' promisees are logged for all the bundle promises
            - output from 'reports' promises has nothing prefixed except 'R: '
            - a log line with stack path is generated when the promise type evaluated changes
        - LMDB (symas.com/mdb) is the default database for local data storage : use version 0.9.9 or later
          cf-agent --self-diagnostics (-x) is only implemented for TCDB, not for LMDB
        - port argument in readtcp() and selectservers() may be a
          service name (e.g. "http", "pop3").
        - Enable source file in agent copy_from promises to be a relative path.
	    - file "changes" reporting now reports with log level "notice", instead of "error".
        - process_results default to AND'ing of set attributes if not specified (Redmine #3224)
        - interface is now canonified in sys.hardware_mac[interface] to align with
          sys.ipv4[interface] (Redmine #3418)
        - cf-promises no longer errors on missing bodies when run without --full-check (-c)
        - Linux flavor "SUSE" now correctly spelled with all uppercase in variables and class names
          (Redmine #3734).  The "suse" lowercase version is also provided for convenience (Redmine #5417).
        - $(this.promise_filename) and $(..._dirname) variables are now absolute paths. (Redmine #3839)
        - including the same file multiple times in 'body control inputs' is not an error
        - portnumber in body copy_from now supports service names like
          "cfengine", "pop3" etc, check /etc/services for more.
        - The failsafe.cf policy, run on bootstrap and in some other
          unusual cases, has been extracted from C code into libpromises/failsafe.cf
        - masterfiles
            - cf_promises_validated is now in JSON format
            - timestamp key is timestamp (sec since unix epoch) of last time validated
            - the masterfiles now come from https://github.com/cfengine/masterfiles and are
              not in the core repository
        - cf-serverd calls cf-agent with -Dcfruncommand when executing cf-runagent requests
      - Mark as removed: promise_notkept_log_include, promise_notkept_log_exclude, promise_repaired_log_include,
        promise_repaired_log_exclude, classes_include, classes_exclude, variables_include,
        variables_exclude attributes from report_data_select body (syntax is valid but not functional).
        They have been replaced by the following attributes: promise_handle_include, 
        promise_handle_exclude, metatags_include, metatags_exclude.

        New features:
        - New promise type "users" for managing local user accounts.
        - TLS authentication and fully encrypted network protocol.
          Additions specific to the new type of connections:
            - New attribute "allowlegacyconnects" in body server control,
              which enables serving policy via non-latest cfengine protocol,
              to the given list of hosts. If the option is absent, it
              defaults to allow all hosts. To refuse non-TLS connections,
              specify an empty list.
            - New attribute "protocol_version" in body copy_from, and body
              common control, which defines the preferred protocol for
              outgoing connections.. Allowed values at the moment: "0" or
              "undefined", "classic" or "1", "latest" or "2". By leaving the
              copy_from option as undefined the common control option is
              used, and if both are undefined then classic protocol is used
              by default.
            - The new networking protocol uses TLS for authentication,
              after which all dialog is encrypted within the established
              TLS session.  cf-serverd is still able to speak the legacy
              protocol with old agents.
            - The 'skipverify' option in 'body server control' is
              deprecated and only left for compatibility; it does
              nothing
            - cf-serverd does not hang up the connection if some request
              fails, so that the client can add more requests.
            - For the connections using the new protocol, all of the
              paths in bundle server access_rules now differentiate
              between a directory and a file using the trailing
              slash. If the path exists then this is auto-detected and
              trailing slash appended automatically. You have to append
              a trailing slash manually to an inexistent or symbolic
              path (e.g. "/path/to/$(connection.ip)/") to force
              recursive access.
        - New in 'access' promises for 'bundle server access_rules'
            - Attributes "admit_ips", "admit_hostnames", "admit_keys",
              "deny_ips", "deny_hostnames", "deny_keys"
            - "admit_keys" and "deny_keys" add the new functionality
              of controlling access according to host identity,
              regardless of the connecting IP.
            - For these new attributes, regular expressions
              are not allowed, only CIDR notation for "admit/deny_ips", exact
              "SHA=..." strings for "admit/deny_keys", and exact hostnames
              (e.g. "cfengine.com") or subdomains (starting with dot,
              e.g. ".cfengine.com") for "admit/deny"_hostnames. Same rules
              apply to 'deny_*' attributes.
            - These new constraints and the paths in access_rules, can contain
              special variables "$(connection.ip)", "$(connection.hostname)",
              "$(connection.key)", which are expanded dynamically for every
              received connection.
            - For connections using the new protocol, "admit" and "deny"
              constraints in bundle server access_rules are being phased
              out, preferred attributes are now "admit_ips", "deny_ips",
              "admit_hostnames", "deny_hostnames", "admit_keys",
              "deny_keys". 
            - New "shortcut" attribute in bundle server access_rules used to
              dynamically expand non-absolute request paths.
        - masterfiles
                - standard library split: lib/3.5 (compatibility) and lib/3.6 (mainline)
                - many standard library bundles and bodies, especially packages- and file-related,
                  were revised and fixed
                - supports both Community and Enterprise
                - new 'inventory/' structure to provide OS, dmidecode, LSB, etc. system inventory
                  (configured mainly in def.cf)
                - cf_promises_release_id contains the policy release ID which is the GIT HEAD SHA
                  if available or hash of tree
                - a bunch'o'bundles to make starting with CFEngine easier:
                - file-related: file_mustache, file_mustache_jsonstring, file_tidy, dir_sync, file_copy,
              file_link, file_hardlink, file_empty, file_make
                - packages-related: package_absent, package_present, package_latest,
              package_specific_present, package_specific_absent, package_specific_latest, package_specific
                - XML-related: xml_insert_tree_nopath, xml_insert_tree, xml_set_value, xml_set_attribute
                - VCS-related: git_init, git_add, git_checkout, git_checkout_new_branch,
              git_clean, git_stash, git_stash_and_clean, git_commit, git
                - process-related: process_kill
                - other: cmerge, url_ping, logrotate, prunedir
        - New command line options for agent binaries
            - New options to cf-promises

                - the module protocol accepts JSON for data containers with the '%' sigil
            - Tagging of classes and variables allows annotating of language construct with
              meta data; supporting functionality:

        Bug fixes: for a complete list of fixed bugs, see Redmine at https://cfengine.com/dev
        - various fixes in evaluation and variable resolution
        - Improve performance of list iteration (Redmine #1875)
        - Removed limitation of input length to internal buffer sizes
            - directories ending with "/" are not ignored
            - lsdir() always return a list now, never a scalar
        - 'abortclasses' fixed to work in common bundles and other cases

        - lots of leaks (memory and file descriptor) fixed

3.5.3
       Changes:
       - Improved security checks of symlink ownership. A symlink created by a user pointing
         to resources owned by a different user will no longer be followed.
       - Changed the way package versions are compared in package promises. (Redmine #3314)
         In previous versions the comparison was inconsistent. This has been fixed, but may
         also lead to behavior changes in certain cases. In CFEngine 3.5.3, the comparison
         works as follows:
           <package-being-considered> <package_select> <package_version>
         For instance:
                 apache-2.2.31              ">="            "2.2.0"
         will result in the package being installed.

3.5.1

       Changes:
       - file changes are logged with log level Notice, not Error
       - the CFEngine Standard Library in masterfiles/libraries is now split into
         promise-type specific policy files, and lives in a version-specific directory.
         This should have no impact on current code, but allows more granular include of
         needed stdlib elements (Redmine #3044)

       Bug fixes:
       - fix recursive copying of files (Redmine #2965)
       - respect classes in templates (Redmine ##2928)

       - classes promises now take an optional scope constraint.
       - new built-in functions: every, none, some, nth, sublist, uniq, filter
         - every
         - none
         - some
         - nth
         - sublist
         - uniq
         - filter
         - classesmatching
         - strftime
         - filestat
         - ifelse
         - maparray
         - format
       - cf-promises flag --parse-tree is replaced by --policy-output-format=, requiring the
          user to specify the output format (none, cf, json)
       - cf-promises allows partial check of policy (without body common control) without integrity check;
          --full-check enforces integrity check
       - agent binaries support JSON input format (.json file as generated by cf-promises)
       - cf-key: new options --trust-key/-t and --print-digest/-p
       - Class "failsafe_fallback" is defined in failsafe.cf when main policy contains errors and
         failsafe is run because of this
       - add scope attribute for body classes (Redmine #2013)
       - Better diagnostics of parsing errors
       - Error messages from parser now show the context of error
       - new cf-agent option: --self-diagnostics
       - new output format, and --legacy-output
       - warnings for cf-promises.
       - Enable zeroconf-discovery of policy hubs for automatic bootstrapping
         if Avahi is present
       - Support for sys.cpus on more platforms than Linux & HPUX

       Changes:
       - parser no longer allows ',' after promiser or promisee. must be either ';' or lval
       - Make parser output in GCC compatible format the only supported format
         (remove --gcc-brief-format flag)

       - Silence license warnings in Enterprise Free25 installations
       - action_policy => "warn" causes not_kept classes to be set on promise needing repair.
       - command line option version (-V) now prints a shorter parsable version without graphic
       - implicit execution of server and common bundles taking arguments is skipped in cf-serverd.
       - WARNING: option --policy-server removed, require option to --bootstrap instead
       - process promises don't log if processes are out of range unless you
         run in verbose mode
       - reports promises are now allowed in any context (Redmine #2005)
       - cf-report has been removed
       - cf-execd: --once implies --no-fork
       - Version info removed from mail subject in the emails sent by cf-execd.
         The subject will only contain "[fqname/ipaddress]" instead of "communnity/nova [fqname/ipaddress]"
         Please change your email filters accordingly if necessary.
       - "outputs" promise type is retired. Their semantics was not clear, and the functionality
         is better suited for control body setting, not a promise.
       - Tokyo Cabinet databases are now automatically checked for
         correctness during opening. It should prevent a number of issues
         with corrupted TC databases causing binaries to hang.
       - Improved ACL handling on Windows, which led to some syntax changes. We now consistently
         use the term "default" to describe ACLs that can be inherited by child objects. These
         keywords have received new names:
           acl_directory_inherit -> acl_default
            specify_inherit_aces -> specify_default_aces
         The old keywords are deprecated, but still valid. In addition, a new keyword
         "acl_inherit" controls inheritance behavior on Windows. This feature does not exist on
         Unix platforms. (Redmine #1832)
       - Networking code is moved from libpromises to its own library,
         libcfnet. Work has begun on making the API more sane and thread-safe.
         Lots of legacy code was removed.
       - Add getaddrinfo() replacement in libcompat (borrowed from PostgreSQL).
       - Replace old deprecated and non thread-safe resolver calls with
         getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo().
       - Hostname2IPString(), IPString2Hostname() are now thread-safe, and are
         returning error when resolution fails.
       - Running cf-execd --once now implies --no-fork, and also does not wait
         for splaytime to pass.
       - execresult(), returnszero() and commands promises no longer requires the first word
         word to be an absolute path when using the shell. (Part of Redmine #2143)
       - commands promises useshell attribute now accepts "noshell" and "useshell" values. Boolean
         values are accepted but deprecated. (Part of Redmine #2143)
       - returnszero() now correctly sets the class name in this scenario  (Part of
         Redmine #2143):
           classes:
             "commandfailed" not => returnszero("/bin/nosuchcommand", "noshell");

       - Make sure "restart" and "reload" are recognized keywords in packages. (Redmine #2468)
       - Allocate memory dynamically to avoid out-of-buffer or out-of-hash
         situations
       - fix edit_xml update of existing attributes  (Redmine #2034)
       - use failsafe policy from compile-time specified workdir (Redmine #1991)
       - ifvarclass checked from classes promises in common bundles
       - do not wait for splaytime when executing only once

          child nodes

        - edit_xml: improve error logging

3.4.0

	New features:

	- Added rpmvercmp utility to compare versions of RPM packages for
	  accurate sorting of RPM packages for packages promises.

	- Implement network timeout on server side to avoid keeping stale
	  connections for hours.

	- XML editing capabilities. See the documentation for edit_xml
	  body. Note the new dependency: libxml2.

	- Implement inheritance of local classes by bundles called using
	  "usebundle". By default classes are not inherited. See the
	  examples/unit_inherit.cf for an example.

	- Moved from Nova/Enterprise:
	  - POSIX ACL support,
	  - "outputs" promise type,
	  - remote syslog support.

	- packages_default_arch_command hook in packages promises, to
	  specify default architecture of the packages on the system.

	- packages_version_less_command / packages_version_equal_command hooks
	  in packages promises, to specify external command for native package
	  manager versions comparison

	- agent_expireafter in body executor control allows you to set a
	  timeout on all cf-agent runs, to enforce a threshold on the
	  number of concurrent agents

	- Running in Solaris zone is now detected and classes "zone" and
	  "zone_<name>" are created in this case.

	- VirtualBox support added to guest_environment promises.

	- guest_environment promises are supported under OS X.

	- The "depends_on" attribute is now active, for the partal ordering
	  of promises. If a promise depends on another (referred by handle)
	  it will only be considered if the depends_on list is either kept
	  or repaired already.

	  ** WARNING: When upgrading, make sure that any existing use
		      of depends_on does not make some promises being
		      unintentionally ignored. This can happen if you are
		      currently referring to non-existent or never-run handles
		      in depends_on attributes.

	- methods return values, initial implementation

	- New format for cf-key -s, includes timestamp of last connection

	- cf-promises --parse-tree option to parse policy file and dump it
	  in JSON format

	- Namespaces support for bundles and bodies. See the
	  examples/unit_namespace*.cf for the usage.

	- Default arguments for bundles. See the examples/unit_defaults.cf

	- Metadata promise type. See the examples/unit_meta.cf

	New semantics:

	- Methods promises now return the status of promises
	  kept within them. If any promise was not kept, the method is not
	  kept, else if any promise is repaired, the method was repaired
	  else it was kept.
	- Remote variable access in namespaces by $(namespace:bundle.variable)

	Changed functionality:

	- cf-execd -F switch no longer implies 'run once'. New -O/--once
	  option is added to achieve this behaviour. This makes cf-execd
	  easier to run from systemd, launchd and other supervision
	  systems.

	Misc:

	- Support for the following outdated platforms and corresponding
	  classes has been removed. De facto those platforms were
	  unsupported for a long time, as CFEngine codebase uses C99
	  language features unavailable on old platforms:

	   - SunOS 3.x (sun3)
	   - SunOS 4.x (sun4)
	   - Ultrix (ultrix)
	   - DEC OSF/1 AXP (osf)
	   - Digital UNIX (digital)
	   - Sony NEWS (newsos)
	   - 4.3BSD (bsd4_3)
	   - IRIX (irix, irix4, irix64)
	   - IBM Academic Operating System (aos)
	   - BSD/OS / BSDi / BSD/386 (bsdos)
	   - NeXTSTEP (nextstep)
	   - GNU Hurd (gnu)
	   - NEC UX/4800 (ux4800)

	- (Old news) Since 3.3.0 the layout of CFEngine Community packages
	  has changed slightly.

	  cf-* binaries have been moved to /var/cfengine/bin, due to the
	  following reasons:

	   - cf-* binaries are linked to libraries installed to
	     /var/cfengine/lib, so placing binaries in /usr/local/sbin does not
	     increase reliability of the CFEngine,

	   - keeping whole CFEngine under single prefix (/var/cfengine)
	     makes packaging simpler,

	   - it matches the layout of CFEngine Enterprise packages.

	   Please adjust your policies (the recommended ways to deal with
	   the move are either to adjust $PATH to include /var/cfengine or to
	   create symlinks in /usr/local/sbin in case you are relying on
	   binaries to be available in $PATH).

	- Workdir location is properly changed if --prefix or --enable-fhs
	  options are supplied to configure (Mantis #1195).

	- Added check for broken libmysqlclient implementations (Mantis #1217).

	- Standard library is updated from COPBL repository.

	- cf-know is no longer built in Community releases. The only
	  functionality useful in Community, namely the reference manual
	  generation, is provided by new compile-time cf-gendoc tool.

    - Filename (for storing filechanges) changed
      from file_change.log -> file_changes.log (in /var/cfengine/state)

      New format for storing file changes introduced:
      [timestamp,filename,<N/C/S/R>,Message]

      N = New file found
      C = Content Changed
      S = Stats changed
      R = File removed

	- Acceptance test suite passes on Mac OS X.

	- Changed some port numbers to replace old services with imap(s)

	- archlinux hard class on Arch Linux.

	- Detect BSD Make and automatically switch to GNU Make during build.

	Bugfixes:

	- cfruncommand for cf-execd is an arbitrary shell command now (Mantis #1268).
	- Fixed broken "daily" splayclasses (Mantis #1307).
	- Allow filenames up to 4096 bytes in network transfers (Redmine #1199).
	- Fix stale state preserved during cf-serverd reload (Redmine #1487).
	- Free disk space calculation is fixed (Mantis #1120).
	- Numerous portability bugfixes (especially OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX-related).
	- Compatibility fixes for AIX, HP-UX, Solaris (Mantis #1185, Mantis #1177, Mantis #1109).
	- Fixed broken socklen_t configure check under OpenBSD (Mantis #1168).
	- Fixed hang in cf-promises under OpenBSD (Mantis #1113).
	- Fixed endless loop in evaluating "$()" construct (Mantis #1023).
	- Fixed check for old PCRE versions (Mantis #1262).
	- Fixed insertion of multi-line blocks at the start of file (Mantis #809).
	- Fixed numerous memory leaks.
	- Fixes for metadata that were not resolvable
	- Fixes for namespaces that would not support metadata and variable expansion
	- Point-to-point network interfaces are detected and reported by CFEngine (Mantis #1246)
	- Partial non-GNU userspace support in acceptance testsuite (Mantis #1255)

	Full list of issues fixed is available on
	https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php (old bug tracker)
	and https://cfengine.com/dev/projects/core/versions/34 (new bug tracker)

3.3.9   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Bugfixes:

	- Do not lose hard classes in cf-serverd during policy reload
	  (Mantis #1218).
	- Implement receive network timeout in cf-serverd. Prevents
	  overloading cf-serverd with stale connections.

3.3.8   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Versions 3.3.6, 3.3.7 were internal and weren't released.

	Bugfixes:

	- Propery set sys.domain variable if hostname is fully-qualified.
	- Fixed several small memory leaks.
	- Make network timeout for network reads configurable. Previously
	  it was hardcoded to be 30 seconds, which was not enough for
	  cf-runagent invoking cf-agent on big policies (Mantis #1028).

3.3.5   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Bugfixes:

	- Fixed cf-execd memory leak on hosts with cf-monitord running.
	- Robustify against wrongly-sized entires in embedded databases.

	Standard library:

	- Bugfixes from upstream COPBL repository.
	- standard_services bundle from upstream COPBL repository.


3.3.4   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Fix wrong classes set after installation of several packages
	  using packages promises (Mantis #829).
	- Fix segfault using edit_template on existing file (Mantis #1155).

	Misc:

	- Fix memory leak during re-read of network interfaces'
	  information in cf-execd/cf-serverd.

3.3.3   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Zero-length files are valid for readfile() and similar functions
	  (Mantis #1136).
	- Unchoke agent in case it encounters symlinks in form ./foo
	  (Similar to Mantis #1117).

	Misc:

	- Fix generation of reference manual on machines with umask more
	  relaxed than 022.
	- Use statvfs(3) on OpenBSD to obtain filesystem information
	  (Mantis #1135).

3.3.2   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Do not segfault if file copy was interrupted due to network
	  connectivity or server going away (Mantis #1089).
	- Do not segfault if log_failed attribute is present in body, but
	  log_kept is not (Mantis #1107).
	- Do not mangle relative paths in symlinks during file copy
	  Previously symlink a -> b was mangled to a -> ./b.
	  (Mantis #1117)
	- Properly compare 1.0 and 1.0.1 in packages promises. Previously
	  only versions with equal amount of "segments" were comparable
	  (Mantis #890, #1066).

	Base policy:

	- Properly set permissions on files for /var/cfengine/lib on HP-UX
	  (Mantis #1114).
	- Standard library (cfengine_stdlib.cf) is synced with COPBL
	  repository.

	Misc:

	- Do not create huge file in case corrupted TokyoCabinet database
	  is detected (Mantis #1106).
	- Fix file descriptor leak on error paths, may have caused crashes
	  of cf-execd and cf-serverd (Issue #1096).
	- Fix intermittent segfault in cf-execd (Mantis #1116).
	- Impose an upper limit on amount of listening sockets reported by
	  cf-monitord. Huge amounts of listening sockets caused cf-agent to
	  segfault on next run (Mantis #1098).
	- Add missing function prototypes caused errors during compilation
	  on HP-UX (Mantis #1109).
	- Fix compilation on Solaris 11 (Mantis #1091).

3.3.1   (Bugfix and Stability release)

	Evaluation of policies:

	- Do not cut off name of bundle in variables interpolation (Mantis #975).
	- Do not segfault in function evaluation guarded by ifvaclass clause (Mantis #1084, #864).
	- Do not segfault if "classes" promise does not declare any value to be evaluated (Mantis #1074).
	- Do not segfault in database promises if there is no
	    database_operation provided (Mantis #1046).

	Built-in functions:

	- Fix countclassesmatching() function which was misbehaving trying
	    to match classes starting with alphanumeric symbol (Mantis #1073).
	- Fix diskfree() to return kilobytes, as described in documentation (Mantis #980, #955).
	- Fix hostsseen() function to avoid treating all hosts as not
	    being seen since 1970 (Mantis #886).
	- Do not output misleading error message if readtcp() is unable to connect (Mantis #1085).

	Command-line interface:

	- -d option previously reqired an argument, though help message disagreed (Mantis #1053).
	- Disable --parse-tree option, not ready for the release (Mantis #1063).
	- Acept -h as a --help option.
	- Ensure that cf-execd might be started right after being shut down.

	Misc:

	- Plug file descriptor leak after failed file copy (Mantis #990).
	- Fix unsafe admit rules in default promises.cf (Mantis #1040).
	- Fix splaytime to match documentation: it is specified in minutes, not seconds (Mantis #1099).

	Packaging:

	- Fix owner/group of initscript and profile.d snippet in RPM builds (Mantis #1061, #1058).
	- Fix location of libvirt socket CFEngine uses to connect to libvirtd (Mantis #1072).
	- Install CoreBase to /var/cfengine/masterfiles during installation (Mantis #1075).
	- Do not leave old cf-twin around after upgrade (Mantis #1068)
	- Do not leave rcS.d symlinks after purging .deb package (Mantis #1092).

3.3.0

	New promise types:
	- Guest environments promises, which allow to manipulate virtual
	  machines using libvirt.
	- Database promises, which allow to maintain schema of MySQL and
	  PostgreSQL databases. Database promises are in "technical preview"
	  status: this promise type is subject to change in future.
	- Services promises for Unix, allows abstraction of details
	  on managing any service

	New built-in functions:
	- dirname() to complement lastnode()
	- lsdir()
	- maplist() to apply functions over lists

	New features:
	- Allow defining arrays from modules.
	- Allow both `process_stop' and `signals' constraints in
	  `processes' promises at the same time.
	- cf-promises --gcc-brief-format option to output warnings and
	  errors in gcc-compatible syntax which to ease use "go to next
	  error" feature of text editors.
	- Iteration over lists is now allowed for qualified (non-local) lists.

	New built-in variables and classes (Linux):
	- Number of CPUs: $(sys.cpus), 1_cpu, 2_cpus etc

	New built-in variables and classes (Unices):
	- $(sys.last_policy_update) - timestamp when last policy change was seen by host
	- $(sys.hardware_addresses) - list of MAC adresses
	- $(sys.ip_addresses) - list of IP addresses
	- $(sys.interfaces) - list of network interfaces
	- $(sys.hardware_mac[$iface]) - MAC address for network interface
	- mac_<mac_address>:: - discovered MAC addresses

	Changes:

	- Major cleanup of database handling code. Should radically decrease
	  amount of database issues experienced under heavy load.

	  *WARNING*: Berkeley DB and SQLite backends are *removed*, use
	  Tokyo Cabinet or QDBM instead. Both Tokyo Cabinet and QDBM are
	  faster than Berkeley DB in typical CFEngine workloads.

	  Tokyo Cabinet requires C99 environment, so it should be
	  available on every contemporary operating system.

	  For the older systems QDBM, which relies only on C89, is a
	  better replacement, and deemed to be as portable, as Berkeley DB.

	- Change of lastseen database schema. Should radically decrease
	  I/O contention on lasteen database.

	- Automatic reload of policies by cf-execd.
	- Documentation is generated during build, PDF and HTML files are
	  retired from repository.
	- Rarely used feature retired: peer connectivity intermittency calculation.
	- Memory and CPU usage improvements.
	- Testsuite now uses 'make check' convention and does not need root
	  privileges anymore.
	- cf_promises_validated now filled with timestamp, allows digest-copy
	  for policy instead of mtime copy which is safer when clocks are unsynchronised
	- The bundled failsafe.cf policy now has trustkey=false to avoid IP spoofing
	  attacks in default policy
	- See the full list of bugfixes at
	  https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php

        Enabled compilation using HP ANSI C compiler

        Full list of issues fixed is available on
        https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php

3.2.0
	New bootstrap method with single-command bootstrapping:

	- Associated policy template files are added, partially maintained
	  by CFEngine

	Bug fixes for file-editing, package versioning, and embedded
	database corruption (We recommend using TokyoCabinet instead of
	BerkeleyDB if building from source).

	Improved upgrade path for Nova.

	Patches for improved run-agent concurrency

	Reorganization of documentation and community resources

	100% on regression test suite on 3 operating systems
	(Ubuntu, Debian, SuSE on x86-64 hardware)

	Support for multiple release environments

	package_policy update and addupdate now check if user-supplied
	version is larger than currently installed - updates only if so

	Help text of cf-report -r corrected - a list of key hashes is
	required, not ip addresses.

	New Emacs mode for CFEngine policy files (thanks to Ted Zlatanov!)

	Warnings are on edit_line changes can now give greater degree of information
	without spamming promise logs

	Class expressions parser accepts '||' as an alias for '|' again.

	Invalidation of package list cache on installation/removal of
	packages.

	New option cf-key -r to remove host key by IP or hostname.

	Added detection of network interfaces which belong to BSD jails.

	Improve robustness of multi-threaded code, in particular fix
	problems with spurious access denials in server and losing of
	authentication rules after policy reload.

	cf-promises accepts option -b matching cf-agent, which causes it
	to do not complain about missing bundlesequence.

	New functions and(), not(), or() and concat() to ease use of
	ifvarclass() clause.

	Full list of issues fixed is available on
	https://cfengine.com/bugtracker/changelog_page.php

3.1.5
	New class parser, '||' is no longer allowed in expressions (use '|').

	Class setting in the promise types insert_lines, delete_lines,
	replace_patterns, field_edits, vars, classes is restored.

	suspiciousnames implemented.

	New function getvalues().

	New functions parse{read,int,string}array to match read{read,int,string}array.

	Testsuite added to check for core functionality.

	Syslog prefix is fixed to say 'cf3' instead of 'community'.

3.1.4	(Bugfix and Stability release)

	Some urgent patches to 3.1.3.
	Class validation parse bug fixed.
	Global zone handling error for solaris fixed.
	Package architectures handled correctly (bug #456).
	Reading and writing of key name "root-.pub" eliminated (bug #442, #453).
	cf-serverd crash because of race condition on SERVER_KEYSEEN fixed.
	Lock purging to avoid remnant complexity explosion (bug #430).
	Some copyright notices added that got lost.

3.1.3   (Stability release)

	Major memory leaks in cf-monitord, cf-execd, cf-serverd fixed (bug #427).
	The daemons now show no growth even with very complex policies.

	cf-serverd crash due to race condition in DeleteScope() fixed (bug #406).

	Added 30 second timeout on recv() on Linux.

	package_noverify_returncode implemented (bug #256).

	A flexible mechanism for setting classes based on return codes of
	commands has been introduced. Allows for setting promise kept,
	repaired or failed based on any return codes. This is currently
	implemented for commands-promises, package-manager commands and
	transformer in files. In classes body, see attributes
	kept_returncodes, repaired_returncodes, failed_returncodes (bug
	#248, #329).

	New function ip2host - reverse DNS lookup (bug #146).

3.1.2   (Scalability/efficiency release)

	Big efficiency improvements by caching output from
	cf-promises. Can also be used for much more efficient policy
	deployment (only pull if changed).

	Caching state of ps command for greater efficiency. Reloaded for each bundle.

	Index class lookup improves efficiency of class evaluation for huge configurations.

        Fixed issue where certain promiser strings got corrupted.

	Minor memory access issues fixed.

	Iterator bug introduced in 3.1.0 fixed

3.1.1   (Bugfix release)

	Memory leaks in server tracked down and fixed.
	List expansion bug (one list items not executed) fixed.
	Security issue introduced by change of runcommand shell policy fixed. If users defined a runcommand for cf-runagent/cf-serverd communication, possible to execute commands.
	cf-key -s command for showing key hash/IP address identity pairs

3.1.0
	Change in storage of public keys. Cfengine now hashes the public key and uses this
	as the keyname. Keys will be converted automatically.

	The old dynamic addresses lists are deprecated.
	Caching of dns and key information for greater server speed.
	Change in last-seen format reflects the public key usage.

	New package policy addupdate - installs package if not there and
	updates it otherwise.

	Support for package_changes => "bulk" in file repository as well.

	New special function readstringarrayidx, similar to readstringarray,
	but uses integer indices. Very useful if first row elements are
	not good identifiers (e.g. contains spaces, non-unique, etc.).

	Change two log formats to use time() instead of date()
	- filechanges
	- total compliance

	Change from using md5 to sha256 as default digest for commercial version,
	community retains md5 for compat.

	Commands not returning 0 in commands-promises are flagged
	as repair_failed.

	Adjustable timeout on connect(). Defaults to 10 seconds, adjustable
	with default_timeout in agent control.

	Redesign of the knowledge map infrastructure.

	Now possible to use variables to call methods, e.g

	methods:

	  "name $(list)" usebundle => $(list)("abc");

	See reference manual notes

	Changes to normal ordering to optimize execution.

	Increased stability by always initializing Attribute and Promise
	structures.

	When running cf-promises in dry-run mode (-n), the user does not need
	to put binaries in WORKDIR/bin. For example, non-privileged users can verify root
	policies.

	Source control revision added in version string if run in verbose mode
	(e.g. "cf-promises -vV"). This needs some refining, uses revision of a header now.

	New semantics in return values of list functions. Null values are now allowed
	and there is no iteration over empty lists. The value "cf_null" is reserved for
	use as a null iterator.

3.0.5p1
        Showing paths allowed/denied access to when cf-serverd is run in verbose mode.
	Bug in server fixed for dynamic addresses.
	File handle closure bugfix - too many open databases.
	Seg fault in mount files fix.
	Twin used in cf-execd without checking.
	Check_root set wrong directory permissions at source not destination.
	Error message degraded in body definition.
	Undefined body not warned as error.
	Various build enahncements.
	Package_list_update called only once per manager, and fixed crash.
	Version number bug in packages.

3.0.5
        Encryption problems fixed - client key buffer was uninitialized.

        Classes-promisers are now automatically canonified when class
	strings are defined, to simplifying the use of variables in classes.

        New scalars sys.cf_version and sys.nova_version that hold Cfengine version information.

        Attribute package_delete_convention added, to allow customizable
	package name in delete command during update.

	package_list_update_ifelapsed limit added.

	Private variable $(firstrepo) is available in package_name_convention
        and package_delete_convention in order to expand the full path to
	a package, which is required by some managers.

	Some of the threading code is rewritten and made more robust. This includes
	synchronizing access to the lastseen database from the server.

        Bad initialization of BSD flags fixed
	Multiple variable expansion issues in control fixed for server and agent
	Allow ignore_missing_bundles to affect methods: bundles too
	Run agent trust dialogue fixed

	Bug in CPU monitoring, increasing time scale caused linear decay
	of CPU measurement.

	Bug in Setuid log storage, fix.

	Hooks added for new Nova virtualization promises.

	Multithreading mutex failed to collide during cfservd leading to dropped authentication under heavy load.


3.0.4
	Class cancellation in promises to create better class feedback,
	allows emulation of switch/case semantics etc

	Value of SA measurement promises

	Special function getenv() which returns the contents of an
	environment variable (on all platforms).
	New function translatepath for generic Windows
	New function escape() to escape literals as regular expressions (like SQL)
        New function host2ip for caching IP address lookup
	New function regextract for setting variables with backreferences

	New variables for the components $(sys.cf_agent), $(sys.cf_know) etc
	pointing to the binaries.

	More robust integrated database implementation; closing all
	handles when receiving signals, self-healing on corruption.

	Package installation on localhost without a manager like yum completed,
	multiple repositories searched, and universal methods.

	Numerous bugfixes


3.0.3
	sha256 .. new hashes in openssl included in syntax tree.

	End of line autocropping in readfile (hopefully intelligent)

	hashmatch function incorrectly implemented - old debugging code left behind. Fix.

	sys.crontab variable

	Unknown user is now interpretated as "same user", so that we give cfengine a chance to
	fix

	Unregistered addresses no longer report "(Non registered IP)", but return as the address
	itself when doing reverse lookups.

3.0.2
	IMPORTANT: Change in normal ordering of editing. replace comes
	after insert lines Much testing and minor bug fixing

	Memory leaks fixed
	Many hooks added for Nova enterprise extensions.

        promise_output reports now placed in WORKDIR/reports directory

	Initialization correction and self-correx in monitord

	Many new body constraints added.

	Code readied for enterprise version Nova.

	-b option can override the bundlesequence (must not contain parameters yet)

	collapse_destination_dir option added to copy so that files can be
	aggregated from subdirectories into a single destination.
