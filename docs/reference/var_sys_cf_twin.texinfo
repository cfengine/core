A variable containing the path to the cfengine agent's twin
@code{cf-twin} on the platform you are using. A twin is simply a
second copy of the agent in Cfengine's work directory @samp{bin} area,
used during upgrades and cases where modification of the
@code{cf-agent} binary could be attempted (this is not allowed on some
platforms, such as Windows).

@verbatim
body executor control
{
exec_command => "$(sys.cf_twin) -f failsafe.cf && $(sys.cf_agent)";
}

@end verbatim
