Classes promises refer to the classification of different
run-contexts.  These are not related to object oriented classes, they
are more like tag labels representing different properties of the
environement.

The term classes was introduced before the widespread use of the term in
Object Orientation, and has since stuck. Today, we use the words class
and context interchangeably.
