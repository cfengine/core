# CF3_PATH_ROOT_PROG(variable, program, value-if-not-found, path = $PATH)
# --------------------------------------
#
# This function has almost the same semantics as the AC_PATH_PROG
# function. The difference is that this will detect tools that are
# runnable by root, but not by the current user. These tools are
# typically used not by the build, but by CFEngine itself, after
# it is installed.
