This directory contains Python packages and modules for working with CFEngine
and its libraries.

If you want to use one of these, PYTHONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables can
make things easier when used like this:

  PYTHONPATH=/var/cfengine/lib/python LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/var/cfengine/lib python3

That will make sure that the bindings are found by Python and that CFEngine's
libraries are found by dlopen() (used by ctypes.CDLL() etc.).
