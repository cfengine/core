# Reachable bundle tests verify that you are allowed have references
# to undefined bundles, as long as they are not actually called.

# These tests are left very simple on purpose,
# they are not using the test framework.
# They should be seen together, note that defined vs undefined variants are
# almost identical, just replacing one detail to show what should work
# and what should error.

bundle agent foo
{
  # foo exists but it's not the bundle we are looking for
}

bundle agent main
{
  methods:
    "foo"
      usebundle => bar; # Should error because bar does not exist
}
